# Meta-Narrative Theory Project

## Overview
This repository contains the complete meta-narrative theory—a universal system of protocols, equations, laws, arguments, guides, and abolishments for reality, story, and agency. The project is designed to be scientifically rigorous, philosophically robust, and accessible to all walks of life.

## Mission
- To formalize a future-proof, testable, and adaptable framework for understanding and creating reality, stories, and agents.
- To abolish harmful ideas from real-world systems and future narratives, promoting restoration, agency, and universal flourishing.
- To provide practical guides, reflections, and models for every profession, background, and contributor.

## Structure
- **arguments/**: Philosophical, scientific, and narrative objections and responses.
- **math/**: Formal equations, models, and logic for the meta-narrative system.
- **laws/**: Foundational laws governing reality and narrative.
- **protocols/**: Universal protocols for agents, restoration, and coherence.
- **guides/**: Practical guides for all walks of life.
- **abolishments/**: Harmful ideas targeted for abolition.
- **hypotheses/**: Advanced questions, models, and scenario guides.
- **predictions/**: Scenario modeling and future predictions using meta-narrative logic.
- **reflection/**: Personal and AI reflections on the project.
- **memory/**: Logs, persistent memory, and project insights.
- **code/**: TypeScript models and implementations.

## Getting Started
