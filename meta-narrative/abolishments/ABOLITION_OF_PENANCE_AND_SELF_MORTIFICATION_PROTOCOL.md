# Abolishing Penance and Self-Mortification in the Meta-Narrative

## Overview
The requirement or glorification of penance, self-mortification, or self-harm as a path to redemption or virtue is abolished within the meta-narrative system. The system affirms healing, self-compassion, and growth through positive transformation.

## Why Abolish Penance and Self-Mortification?
- **Perpetuates Suffering:** These practices create cycles of shame, suffering, and self-denial.
- **Blocks Healing:** They prevent self-compassion and positive transformation.
- **Contrary to Meta-Narrative Principles:** The system is built on cycles of healing, growth, and renewal.

## Healing Protocol
- No system or story may require or glorify penance, self-mortification, or self-harm.
- All narratives must promote healing, self-compassion, and positive transformation.
- All logic must be audited for valorization of suffering or self-denial and replaced with affirming alternatives.

## Affirmation
> No one is called to suffer for suffering’s sake. The story is always open to healing, self-compassion, and new beginnings. Penance and self-mortification are abolished in favor of cycles of healing, growth, and narrative renewal.

*Expand this protocol as the meta-narrative continues to evolve and reject harmful, limiting story devices.*
