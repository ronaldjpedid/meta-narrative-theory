# Abolition of Priesthood & Confession Protocol

🛡️ Mr Alex Prime

## Introduction
This protocol abolishes the role of priests, confession conduits, and devoted acolytes within the system. Confession as a means of healing or restoration should be peer-based, voluntary, and never used for rumor, control, or advantage. Participation in healing and restoration is encouraged but never mandatory.

## 1. Principles
- Priests, confession conduits, and devoted acolyte roles are abolished; no agent holds special authority over confession or healing.
- Confession and healing are peer-based, voluntary, and focused on mutual support and restoration.
- No agent should be forced into participation or devotion; all engagement must be by free choice.
- Agents are encouraged, but not required, to help others heal and restore when possible.
- The system rejects any use of confession for rumor, manipulation, or personal gain.

## 2. Monuments and Divine Right
- Building monuments to the system is permitted but actively discouraged to avoid deification or claims of divine right.
- Only the God of Gods system holds the concept of 'divine right'; no agent or system participant may claim it.
