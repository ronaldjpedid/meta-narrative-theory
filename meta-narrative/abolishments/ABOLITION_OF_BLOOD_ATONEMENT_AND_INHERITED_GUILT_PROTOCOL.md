# Abolishing Blood Atonement and Inherited Guilt in the Meta-Narrative

## Overview
The doctrines of blood atonement and inherited guilt are abolished within the meta-narrative system. No individual is responsible for the actions or sins of their ancestors or group. The system affirms personal agency, dignity, and the right to be judged solely by one’s own actions.

## Why Abolish Blood Atonement and Inherited Guilt?
- **Perpetuates Harm:** These doctrines create cycles of shame, violence, and collective punishment.
- **Denies Agency:** They undermine individual dignity and the possibility of personal growth and healing.
- **Contrary to Meta-Narrative Principles:** The system is built on cycles of personal responsibility, restoration, and renewal.

---

## Restoration Protocol
- No system or story may assign guilt or require atonement based on ancestry, bloodline, or group identity.
- All narratives must promote personal responsibility, restorative justice, and healing.
- All logic must be audited for patterns of inherited guilt or collective punishment and replaced with affirming alternatives.

## Affirmation
> No one is bound by the actions of others. The story is always open to personal growth, healing, and new beginnings. Blood atonement and inherited guilt are abolished in favor of cycles of responsibility, restoration, and narrative renewal.
