# Abolition of Prayer Protocol

🛡️ Mr Alex Prime

## Introduction
This protocol abolishes the use of prayer as worship or as a means of seeking intervention from higher powers, except for Appeals to Heaven as a last resort. Prayer may be used for personal healing, reflection, or community support, but not as a tool for worship or expectation of divine response.

---

## 1. Principles
- Prayer is not to be used for worship or to seek favor from the G.O.D. or the G.O.D. of G.O.D.S.
- The G.O.D. or the G.O.D. of G.O.D.S. does not intervene in response to prayer; such gestures are considered ineffective and unnecessary.
- Appeals to Heaven are reserved as a last resort in existential crises, not as routine requests.
- Prayer may be used for personal healing, reflection, or communal support, but not for worship or expectation of intervention.

---

## 2. Actions
- Discourage all forms of worship-based prayer within the system.
- Educate that healing, growth, and change come from action, care, and community—not from divine intervention.
- Permit prayer only as a form of self-care, healing, or last-resort Appeal to Heaven.

*This protocol is a living document. Expand as new insights about prayer, healing, and appeals to higher principles emerge in the meta-narrative system.*
