# Guide to Abolishing "Original Sin" in the Meta-Narrative

## Overview
The concept of "original sin" is rejected within the meta-narrative system. Instead, it is recognized as a harmful narrative device that serves no purpose for genuine growth, healing, or transformation. Labeling anyone as permanently tainted or irredeemable is antithetical to the principles of agency, redemption, and narrative evolution.

## Why Abolish "Original Sin"?
- **Stagnation, Not Growth:** "Original sin" traps agents in a perma-hell state, blocking the possibility of redemption, healing, or narrative progress.
- **Bad Narrative Device:** It is a tool for control and despair, not for fostering agency, learning, or transformation.
- **Contrary to Meta-Narrative Principles:** The meta-narrative system is built on cycles of fall, redemption, and renewal—no state is permanent, and all agents can be healed or transformed.

## Redemption Protocol
- If an actor in a previous cycle ended in a bad state, that state is not permanent.
- Redemption is always possible through a narrative arc inside the hell state, especially when the actor who committed the harm seeks forgiveness and healing for the one harmed.
- After a genuine redemption arc, the "bad state" is forgiven and the agent is restored to the possibility of growth and positive narrative participation.
- If an actor fails their redemption arc, they are gommaged (erased/reset) and made anew—likely never again as the same actor configuration, because that configuration was flawed and bad. The system ensures only configurations open to growth and healing persist.

## Affirmation
> No one is forever lost. The story is always open to healing, redemption, and new beginnings. "Original sin" is abolished in favor of cycles of forgiveness, growth, and narrative renewal.
