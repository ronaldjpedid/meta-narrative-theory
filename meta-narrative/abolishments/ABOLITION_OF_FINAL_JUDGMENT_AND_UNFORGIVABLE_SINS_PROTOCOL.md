# Abolishing Final Judgment and Unforgivable Sins in the Meta-Narrative

## Overview
The concept of a final, irrevocable judgment and the existence of unforgivable sins are abolished within the meta-narrative system. The system affirms the possibility of growth, learning, and redemption for all.

## Why Abolish Final Judgment and Unforgivable Sins?
- **Fosters Despair:** These concepts create exclusion and deny human potential.
- **Blocks Growth:** They prevent ongoing learning, change, and restoration.
- **Contrary to Meta-Narrative Principles:** The system is built on cycles of growth, learning, and reconciliation.

## Redemption Protocol
- No system or story may posit final, unchangeable judgment or unforgivable acts.
- All narratives must allow for ongoing learning, change, and restoration.
- All logic must be audited for finality or irredeemability and replaced with restorative, hopeful alternatives.

## Affirmation
> No one is forever condemned. The story is always open to growth, learning, and new beginnings. Final judgment and unforgivable sins are abolished in favor of cycles of redemption, restoration, and narrative renewal.
