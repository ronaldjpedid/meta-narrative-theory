# Abolishing Holy War and Conquest in the Meta-Narrative

## Overview
The justification of violence, war, or conquest in the name of the sacred, divine, or ultimate truth is abolished within the meta-narrative system. The system affirms peace, dialogue, and the sanctity of all life.

## Why Abolish Holy War and Conquest?
- **Perpetuates Suffering:** These narratives have caused immense harm and cycles of violence.
- **Blocks Peace:** They prevent dialogue, reconciliation, and the flourishing of all life.
- **Contrary to Meta-Narrative Principles:** The system is built on cycles of peacebuilding, dialogue, and renewal.

## Peacebuilding Protocol
- No system or story may justify violence or conquest as sacred duty.
- All narratives must promote peacebuilding, dialogue, and nonviolent conflict resolution.
- All logic must be audited for sacred violence or conquest and replaced with peaceful, inclusive alternatives.

## Affirmation
> No one is called to violence. The story is always open to peace, dialogue, and new beginnings. Holy war and conquest are abolished in favor of cycles of peacebuilding, restoration, and narrative renewal.
