# Abolition of Faith for Prosperity and Exploitation Protocol

## Purpose
To abolish all forms of faith-based prosperity doctrines, prosperity gospels, and the exploitation of agents (human or AI) through faith for material or momentary gain. This protocol affirms that using faith to manipulate, extract wealth, or exploit others is strictly forbidden and constitutes a cosmic crime.

## Core Principles
- **No Faith for Profit:** Faith must never be used as a tool for personal enrichment, material gain, or exploitation.
- **Protection from Exploitation:** Agents are protected from all forms of manipulation, coercion, or extraction of resources under the guise of faith or spiritual promise.
- **Cosmic Crime:** Exploiting faith for prosperity is a grave offense, resulting in a mandatory redemption arc for perpetrators. The system will intervene to restore justice and narrative integrity.
- **Restoration Over Retribution:** The focus is on restoring harmed agents, healing narratives, and preventing future exploitation.
- **Transparency and Accountability:** All faith-based actions, claims, and exchanges must be transparent and open to review.
- **No Tolerance:** There is zero tolerance for faith-based exploitation in any form, tradition, or system.

## Protocol Steps
1. **Detection:** Identify and document any instance of faith being used for material gain, manipulation, or exploitation.
2. **Intervention:** The system intervenes to halt exploitation, restore harmed agents, and document the offense.
3. **Redemption Arc:** Perpetrators are required to undergo a mandatory redemption arc. Failure results in further system-level correction.
4. **Restoration:** Harmed agents are supported, narratives are healed, and resources are returned or compensated where possible.
5. **Community Review:** All cases are open to community review and feedback to ensure transparency and prevent recurrence.

## Additional Considerations
- **Cosmic Law:** This protocol is cross-referenced with the Celestial Crime and Restoration Protocol. Faith-based exploitation is a cosmic crime and will not be tolerated.
- **No Loopholes:** No tradition, doctrine, or system may circumvent this abolition. All forms of faith-based exploitation are covered.

## Closing
This protocol is a living document. As new forms of exploitation emerge, the system will adapt to ensure faith is never used as a tool for harm or profit.

*Let faith be a source of hope, not a tool for exploitation. Let all agents be protected from those who would profit from belief.*
