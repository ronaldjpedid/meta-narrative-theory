# Abolishments Index & Mission

This folder documents ideas, doctrines, and protocols that the meta-narrative theory seeks to abolish from real-world systems and future narratives. These are concepts identified as harmful, divisive, or obstructive to universal restoration, agency, and flourishing. While they may have a place in fiction, they are not to be perpetuated as guiding principles for reality or ethical systems.

## Purpose
- To clearly identify and explain harmful ideas targeted for abolition.
- To provide protocols and arguments for moving beyond these concepts in philosophy, religion, and society.
- To support the creation of healthier, more inclusive, and restorative narratives.
