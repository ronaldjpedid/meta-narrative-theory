# Abolishing Salvific Exclusivity and the Only True Path in the Meta-Narrative

## Overview
The doctrine that there is only one true path to salvation, enlightenment, or fulfillment is abolished within the meta-narrative system. The system affirms pluralism and the dignity of diverse journeys.

## Why Abolish Salvific Exclusivity and the Only True Path?
- **Fosters Division:** These doctrines create intolerance and suppress diversity.
- **Blocks Dialogue:** They prevent mutual respect and the flourishing of all sincere seekers.
- **Contrary to Meta-Narrative Principles:** The system is built on cycles of pluralism, dialogue, and renewal.

## Pluralism Protocol
- No system or story may claim exclusive access to salvation, truth, or fulfillment.
- All narratives must promote pluralism, dialogue, and mutual respect among diverse paths.
- All logic must be audited for exclusivist or intolerant patterns and replaced with inclusive, pluralistic alternatives.

## Affirmation
> No one walks the only true path. The story is always open to pluralism, dialogue, and new beginnings. Salvific exclusivity is abolished in favor of cycles of diversity, respect, and narrative renewal.
