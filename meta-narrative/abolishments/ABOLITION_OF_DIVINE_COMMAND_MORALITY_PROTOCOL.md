# Abolishing Divine Command Morality in the Meta-Narrative

## Overview
The doctrine that morality is defined solely by the arbitrary commands of a deity or authority is abolished within the meta-narrative system. The system affirms universal principles of autonomy, consent, empathy, and well-being as the basis for moral action.

## Why Abolish Divine Command Morality?
- **Suppresses Ethics:** This doctrine can justify harm and suppress critical thought.
- **Undermines Universal Values:** It denies the intrinsic worth and agency of all beings.
- **Contrary to Meta-Narrative Principles:** The system is built on cycles of reason, empathy, and universal ethics.

## Universal Ethics Protocol
- No system or story may justify actions solely on the basis of divine or authoritarian command.
- All narratives must promote ethical frameworks grounded in autonomy, consent, empathy, and well-being.
- All logic must be audited for divine command patterns and replaced with universal, reasoned ethics.

## Affirmation
> No one is bound by arbitrary command. The story is always open to reason, empathy, and new beginnings. Divine command morality is abolished in favor of cycles of autonomy, consent, and universal ethics.
