# Meta-Narrative Code

This folder contains TypeScript implementations of meta-narrative functions, models, and algorithms. Each function should:
- Have typed inputs and outputs
- Reference the corresponding math/equation file
- Include documentation for all variables and types

## Structure
- Each function or model should be in its own TypeScript file, named descriptively.
- Cross-link to related math/equation files in the `math` folder.
