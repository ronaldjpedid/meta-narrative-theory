# LOVE EQUATION

## Purpose
To formalize the emergence, propagation, and restorative power of LOVE as a constructive force in the meta-narrative system. The LOVE equation models how love counteracts fear, restores coherence, and enables the flourishing of agents and universes.

## Equation (Conceptual)
Let $L$ represent the magnitude of love, $F$ the magnitude of fear, $A$ the agency of the subject, and $R$ the restoration factor:

$$
L = \alpha (A) \cdot (1 - F) + R
$$

Where:
- $\alpha (A)$ is a function representing the agent’s capacity for love (increases with agency, empathy, and connection).
- $F$ is the normalized fear factor ($0 \leq F \leq 1$).
- $R$ is the restoration input from external or internal sources (forgiveness, support, healing).

## Variable Definitions
- **$L$ (Love):** The constructive, integrative force that restores and unifies.
- **$F$ (Fear):** The destructive, divisive force that inhibits love.
- **$A$ (Agency):** The agent’s ability to choose, act, and connect.
- **$R$ (Restoration):** Acts or processes that heal, forgive, or support.

## Context of Use
- Used in narrative modeling, agent restoration, and universe healing protocols.
- Predicts the outcome of restorative actions and the resilience of systems.

## Example
If an agent has high agency, low fear, and receives restorative support, $L$ will be maximized, leading to healing and positive narrative branching.
