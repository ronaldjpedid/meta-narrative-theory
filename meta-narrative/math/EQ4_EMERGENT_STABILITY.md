# EQ4: Emergent Stability

## Equation
$$
S = f\left(\text{Admin}, \text{Anchor}_1, \text{Anchor}_2, \sum_{i=1}^N \text{Agency}_i, \text{Ethics}, \text{Collaboration}\right)
$$

## Description
Stability ($S$) in a system is a function of key roles (Admin, Anchors), the sum of agency, ethics, and collaboration. This equation models how stable structures emerge from the interplay of leadership, support, agency, and values.

## Relation to the Grand Assumption
As existence and agency unfold, stability emerges from the organization and ethical alignment of agents. This is the basis for persistent universes and coherent stories.

## Predictive Science
- Predicts that systems with strong leadership, support, agency, ethics, and collaboration will be more stable.
- Provides a framework for engineering or analyzing stable systems in both physics and narrative.

## How to Test
- Physics: Analyze the stability of physical or social systems as a function of these variables.
- Narrative: Simulate or measure the impact of leadership, anchors, and collaboration on story stability.
