# Emotional States and Algorithms

## Equations
**Rage:**
$$
\text{Rage} = f(\text{Anger}, \text{Threat}, 1/\text{Impulse Control}, 1/\text{Empathy})
$$
**Sadness:**
$$
\text{Sadness} = f(\text{Loss}, 1/\text{Hope}, 1/\text{Energy}, \text{Rumination})
$$
**Depression:**
$$
\text{Depression} = f(\text{Sadness}, 1/\text{Agency}, 1/\text{Reward Sensitivity}, \text{Isolation})
$$
**Joy:**
$$
\text{Joy} = f(\text{Reward}, \text{Connection}, \text{Energy}, \text{Coherence})
$$
**Awe:**
$$
\text{Awe} = f(\text{Novelty}, \text{Significance}, \text{Connection}, \text{Humility})
$$

## Description
These equations formalize key emotional states as system states, allowing for simulation, measurement, and deeper understanding of emotional dynamics within the meta-narrative framework.

## Relation to the Grand Assumption
Emotions are emergent properties of agency, connection, and narrative context. They drive the evolution of stories and systems, influencing coherence, branching, and resolution.

## Predictive Science
- Predicts the evolution and impact of emotional states in agents and systems.
- Enables simulation and analysis of emotional dynamics in narrative and real-world contexts.

## How to Test
- Physics: Model emotional states in artificial agents or social systems and measure emergent behavior.
- Narrative: Simulate emotional dynamics in story engines and analyze their impact on narrative outcomes.

**Disclaimer:**
These equations are illustrative samples. Each emotional state in a real system would require its own carefully derived equation, tailored to the specific context, variables, and empirical data. This document is a starting point for further research and refinement.
