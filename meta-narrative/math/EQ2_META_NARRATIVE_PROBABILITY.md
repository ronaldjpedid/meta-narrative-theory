# EQ2: Meta-Narrative Probability

## Equation
$$
P(\text{meta-narrative}) > 0
$$

## Description
This equation asserts that the probability of a meta-narrative (a story about stories, or a universe of universes) is always greater than zero. In other words, meta-narratives are inevitable and must exist somewhere in the space of all possibilities.

## Relation to the Grand Assumption
If existence is inevitable, then so is the existence of meta-narratives. This equation extends the inevitability of existence to the inevitability of higher-order stories and realities.

## Predictive Science
- Predicts that meta-narratives will always emerge in sufficiently complex systems.
- Suggests that self-referential or recursive stories are a natural outcome of existence.

## How to Test
- Physics: Study the emergence of self-referential or recursive structures in complex systems.
- Narrative: Analyze the frequency and inevitability of meta-narratives in literature, media, and simulated story engines.
