# 3. Binary Pair Stability

## Equations
If $M$ and $D$ are matter/antimatter:
$$
M + D \to \varnothing \quad (\text{annihilation})
$$
If $M$ and $D$ are matter/matter or antimatter/antimatter:
$$
M + D = \text{Stable Binary}
$$

## Description
- Binary pairs can either annihilate (if opposites) or form stable systems (if similar). This is a universal principle in both physics and narrative.

## Relation to Cosmology
- In particle physics, matter/antimatter pairs annihilate, while like pairs can form stable structures (e.g., molecules, stars).
- Binary stars, paired particles, and other cosmic binaries are examples of this principle.

## Narrative Physics
- Characters or forces in opposition may cancel each other out, ending a story branch.
- Like-minded or aligned entities can form lasting bonds, driving the story forward.

## Why This Is Real Physics
- The stability of binaries is a foundation of atomic and cosmic structure.
- The same logic applies to information, relationships, and narrative systems.

## How to Test
- Physics: Study the formation and stability of binary systems in nature.
- Narrative: Model story outcomes based on the nature of pairings (oppositional vs. aligned).
