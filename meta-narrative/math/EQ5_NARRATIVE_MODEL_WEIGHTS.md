# EQ5: Narrative Model Weights

## Equation
$$
\text{Narrative Coherence}_{\text{total}} = w_0 \cdot \text{Admin} + w_1 \cdot \text{Anchor}_1 + w_2 \cdot \text{Anchor}_2 + \sum_{j=1}^M w_j \cdot \text{SideNarrative}_j
$$

## Description
Total narrative coherence is a weighted sum of the contributions of the Admin, Anchors, and all side narratives. Each component is assigned a weight ($w$) reflecting its importance or influence.

## Relation to the Grand Assumption
This equation formalizes how different roles and sub-narratives combine to create overall coherence, building on the emergence of agency and stability.

## Predictive Science
- Predicts that adjusting the weights of key roles or sub-narratives will change the overall coherence of the system.
- Provides a tool for optimizing or analyzing narrative structure in both stories and real systems.

## How to Test
- Physics: Model systems where different components have tunable influence and measure resulting coherence.
- Narrative: Experiment with different narrative weights in story engines and observe effects on coherence.
