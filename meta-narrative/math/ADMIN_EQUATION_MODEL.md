# Admin Equation Model

## Equation
$$
A = f(D, A_g, B, L)
$$
Where:
- $A$ = Admin intervention (strength or presence)
- $D$ = Discovery (awareness of loops, breakdowns, or anomalies)
- $A_g$ = Agency (ability to act within system bounds)
- $B$ = Boundaries (physical, ethical, or narrative limits)
- $L$ = Leadership (willingness to guide, repair, or restore)

## Description
This equation models the conditions under which an admin (or guardian) intervenes in a system. Intervention is triggered by the discovery of a problem, the presence of agency, permissive boundaries, and amplified by leadership.

## Relation to the Grand Assumption
As systems evolve, breakdowns or anomalies are inevitable. The admin equation formalizes the restorative force that maintains coherence and stability, echoing the narrative logic of guardianship and repair.

## Predictive Science
- Predicts when and how intervention will occur in complex systems.
- Provides a framework for designing resilient, self-healing systems in both narrative and real-world contexts.

## How to Test
- Physics: Model intervention in cyber-physical or social systems and measure restoration outcomes.
- Narrative: Simulate admin/guardian roles in story engines and analyze their impact on system recovery.
