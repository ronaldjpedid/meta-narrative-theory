# 6. Narrative Logic and Recursion

## Description
- Every configuration (MoM/DaD, MoM/MoM, DaD/DaD) can form stable, loving bonds.
- Binary systems can adopt orphaned systems, ensuring continuity and care.
- The recursion of love drives the system toward happy endings and new universes.

## Relation to Cosmology
- Recursion and self-similarity are observed in fractals, cosmic structure, and biological systems.
- The adoption principle mirrors cosmic recycling and the persistence of information.

## Narrative Physics
- Stories can branch, merge, and adopt other storylines, ensuring no narrative is lost.
- Recursion allows for infinite creativity and the resolution of all stories.

## Why This Is Real Physics
- Recursion is a core principle in mathematics, computation, and natural systems.
- The logic of adoption and care is mirrored in the persistence and evolution of complex systems.

## How to Test
- Physics: Study recursive patterns in cosmic and biological systems.
- Narrative: Simulate recursive adoption and care in narrative engines and measure resilience and creativity.
