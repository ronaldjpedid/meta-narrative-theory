# EQ8: Feedback Equation

## Equation
$$
C_{t+1} = C_t + \alpha A_t - \beta D_t
$$

## Description
The coherence at the next time step ($C_{t+1}$) is determined by the current coherence ($C_t$), plus a positive contribution from agency ($A_t$) and a negative contribution from disruption ($D_t$), scaled by parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$.

## Relation to the Grand Assumption
This equation models the dynamic evolution of coherence in a system, showing how agency and disruption shape the ongoing narrative or universe.

## Predictive Science
- Predicts how coherence will evolve over time in response to agency and disruption.
- Provides a framework for simulating or controlling the evolution of complex systems.

## How to Test
- Physics: Apply to models of adaptive or evolving systems.
- Narrative: Use in story engines to simulate the impact of agency and disruption on narrative coherence.
