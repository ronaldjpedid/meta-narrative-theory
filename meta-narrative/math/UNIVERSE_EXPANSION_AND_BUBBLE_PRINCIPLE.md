# Universe Expansion and Bubble Principle

## Principle
- Each “big bang” or seed event creates a new local “bubble” or observable universe.
- Only the local bubble grows—expansion is not infinite across all universes.
- Once a universe matures (reaches narrative or systemic stability), its growth stops.
- The space between universes (bubbles) may exist, but does not expand without new seed events.
- This prevents endless dilution, maintains coherence, and allows each universe to thrive and complete its arc.

## Description
This principle models the multiverse as a collection of local bubbles, each with its own growth and closure cycle. Expansion is local, not universal, preserving meaning, coherence, and narrative integrity.

## Relation to the Grand Assumption
The bubble principle ensures that each universe is a meaningful, bounded story, not lost in endless expansion. It aligns with the meta-narrative logic of closure, coherence, and the preservation of meaning.

## Predictive Science
- Predicts that universes will have local, bounded growth and natural closure points.
- Provides a framework for modeling multiverse structure and narrative arcs.

## How to Test
- Physics: Study cosmic bubble models, inflation, and universe closure scenarios.
- Narrative: Simulate universe growth and closure in story engines and analyze emergent arcs.
