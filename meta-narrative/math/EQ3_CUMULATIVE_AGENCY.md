# EQ3: Cumulative Agency

## Equation
$$
\text{Narrative Coherence} \propto \sum_{i=1}^N \text{Agency}_i
$$

## Description
This equation states that the coherence of a narrative is proportional to the sum of the agencies of its participants. Agency here means the capacity of an entity to make choices and influence outcomes.

## Relation to the Grand Assumption
As existence unfolds, agency emerges as a key driver of narrative structure and coherence. The more agency present, the more coherent and meaningful the resulting story or universe.

## Predictive Science
- Predicts that systems with higher total agency will exhibit greater narrative coherence and structure.
- Suggests that agency is a measurable, predictive quantity in both physical and narrative systems.

## How to Test
- Physics: Study the role of agency (e.g., free will, decision-making) in complex adaptive systems.
- Narrative: Quantify agency in stories or simulations and correlate with measures of coherence or meaning.
