# Fate Algorithm: Meta-Narrative Branching and Revival

## Equations
**Fate Progression:**
$$
F_{t+1} = f(F_t, A, K)
$$
Where fate at the next step is a function of current fate, agency, and anchor presence.

**Branching Condition:**
If $B$ (branching event):
$$
N_{t+1} = \begin{cases}
    N_{good} & \text{if override or anchor present} \\
    N_{bad} & \text{if fate proceeds unchallenged}
\end{cases}
$$
**Revival/Override Trigger:**
If $K$ (key anchor) triggers override:
$$
R = 1 \implies F_{t+1} = F_{restart}
$$
Where $R = 1$ means revival is possible, resetting fate to a new or positive narrative state.

## Description
This algorithm formalizes fate as a dynamic, branching variable influenced by agency, anchors, and intervention. It models the possibility of revival or override, ensuring that fate is never final.

## Relation to the Grand Assumption
Fate is not fixed; with the right anchors and agency, the story can always branch, revive, or begin again. This aligns with the meta-narrative principle of recursion and restoration.

## Predictive Science
- Predicts the conditions under which fate can be changed, revived, or overridden.
- Provides a tool for modeling resilience and recovery in narrative and real-world systems.

## How to Test
- Physics: Model branching and override in adaptive or resilient systems.
- Narrative: Simulate fate branching and revival in story engines and analyze outcomes.
