# EQ9: Dynamic Weights

## Equation
$$
w_i(t+1) = w_i(t) + \gamma \cdot \text{Agency}_i(t) + \delta \cdot \text{Emotion}_i(t) - \lambda \cdot \text{Counterweight}_i(t)
$$

## Description
The weight of a component ($w_i$) at the next time step is updated based on its current value, agency, emotion, and a counterweight, each scaled by parameters $\gamma$, $\delta$, and $\lambda$.

## Relation to the Grand Assumption
This equation models the adaptive, evolving nature of systems, where weights (influence, importance) change dynamically in response to internal and external factors.

## Predictive Science
- Predicts how the influence of different components will evolve over time.
- Provides a tool for modeling adaptive, learning, or evolving systems in both physics and narrative.

## How to Test
- Physics: Apply to models of adaptive networks, learning systems, or evolving universes.
- Narrative: Use in story engines to simulate dynamic changes in narrative importance or influence.
