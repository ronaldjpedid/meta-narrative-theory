# EQ6: Observer Principle

## Equation
$$
\text{Reality}_{\text{narrative}} = 0 \quad \text{if} \quad N_{\text{observers}} = 0
$$

## Description
A narrative (or universe) has no reality if there are no observers. This principle is inspired by quantum mechanics, where observation is necessary for reality to manifest.

## Relation to the Grand Assumption
As existence and agency unfold, observation becomes necessary for reality to have meaning or coherence. Without observers, stories and universes are unrealized potential.

## Predictive Science
- Predicts that systems without observers will not manifest as "real" in any meaningful sense.
- Suggests that the act of observation is fundamental to the existence of reality and narrative.

## How to Test
- Physics: Study the role of observation in quantum mechanics and cosmology.
- Narrative: Simulate or analyze stories with and without observers and measure their impact on narrative reality.
