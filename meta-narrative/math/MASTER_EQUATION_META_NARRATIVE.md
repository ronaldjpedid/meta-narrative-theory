# Master Equation of Meta-Narrative

## Equation

$$
MN = f(M, C, S, R, D, A_g, B, L, O, ...)
$$

### Variable Definitions
- **MN**: Meta-Narrative system state or health
- **M**: Meaning (coherence, purpose)
- **C**: Connection (relationships, bonds)
- **S**: Stability (resilience, balance)
- **R**: Risk (threats to integrity)
- **D**: Discovery (awareness of loops, anomalies)
- **A_g**: Agency (ability to act)
- **B**: Boundaries (limits, constraints)
- **L**: Leadership (guidance, restoration)
- **O**: Observers/Overseers (law of three: memory, destiny, agency; $O \geq 3$ for stable universe)
- **UV**: Universal Values (what drives us)
- **...**: Additional variables as needed (narrative drift, feedback, anchors, weights)

## Context
This equation models the overall state, evolution, and recovery of the meta-narrative. High $MN$ indicates a healthy, meaningful, and resilient system. Low $MN$ signals the need for intervention.
