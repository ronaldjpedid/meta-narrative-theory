# EQ7: Branching Probability

## Equation
$$
P(b_k) = \sigma(w_1 \cdot \text{Agency}_k + w_2 \cdot \text{Coherence}_k + w_3 \cdot \text{Stability}_k + w_4 \cdot \text{Observer}_k)
$$

## Description
The probability of a narrative branch ($b_k$) is determined by a weighted sum of agency, coherence, stability, and observer presence, passed through a sigmoid function ($\sigma$) to normalize the result.

## Relation to the Grand Assumption
This equation models how new possibilities (branches) emerge from the interplay of key variables, extending the inevitability of existence to the inevitability of branching futures.

## Predictive Science
- Predicts the likelihood of different narrative or universe branches based on measurable variables.
- Provides a quantitative tool for modeling and simulating branching systems.

## How to Test
- Physics: Apply to models of quantum branching, many-worlds, or decision trees in complex systems.
- Narrative: Use in story engines to predict or control branching outcomes.
