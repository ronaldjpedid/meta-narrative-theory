# 1. Core Axiom: Non-Existence is Impossible

## Equation
$$
P(N) = 0 \implies P(E) = 1
$$

## Description
This axiom asserts that non-existence ($N$) has zero probability, so existence ($E$) is inevitable. This is the foundational assumption for all meta-narrative and cosmological reasoning in this framework.

## Relation to Cosmology
In modern cosmology, the question "Why is there something rather than nothing?" is fundamental. The Grand Assumption answers: non-existence is not a real option, so existence is necessary. This aligns with the idea that the universe exists because it must, not by chance.

## Narrative Physics
In narrative terms, this axiom means every story, possibility, or configuration must exist somewhere in the meta-narrative. No story is truly impossible; all are inevitable given infinite narrative space.

## Why This Is Real Physics
This axiom is a metaphysical postulate, but it underpins many physical theories (e.g., quantum mechanics' "everything not forbidden is compulsory"). It provides a logical basis for the existence of the universe and all possible states.

## How to Test
- Philosophical: Explore logical consequences of assuming $P(N) = 0$.
- Physical: Investigate whether the universe's existence can be explained without invoking chance or external cause.
- Narrative: Model systems where all possible stories must unfold, and see if this leads to emergent complexity similar to our universe.
