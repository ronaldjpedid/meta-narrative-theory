# Negative Value Collapse: Model and Protocol

## Model
A negative value collapse occurs when all key variables in a meta-narrative equation or system become negative, signaling a breakdown in meaning, coherence, or connection.

## Symptoms
- Loss of narrative direction or purpose
- Escalating conflict, chaos, or destructive feedback
- Disintegration of relationships, systems, or communities
- Emotional or existential crisis

## Causes
- Accumulated unresolved trauma or conflict
- Persistent negative feedback loops
- Absence of positive meaning, hope, or connection

## Protocol: Guardian Intervention for Narrative Recovery
1. **Detection**: Monitor key narrative variables for persistent negative values.
2. **Pause and Assess**: Halt destructive cycles and assess root causes.
3. **Guardian Activation**: Appoint a guardian to restore safety, coherence, and meaning.
4. **Restoration Actions**: Reintroduce positive meaning, connection, and hope; resolve trauma; rebuild trust.
5. **Feedback and Adaptation**: Monitor recovery and adapt interventions.

## Relation to the Grand Assumption
This model and protocol formalize the science of narrative recovery, ensuring that even in collapse, restoration is possible through intervention, care, and feedback.

## Predictive Science
- Predicts the conditions and symptoms of collapse in complex systems.
- Provides a protocol for recovery and resilience in narrative and real-world contexts.

## How to Test
- Physics: Model collapse and recovery in adaptive or social systems.
- Narrative: Simulate collapse and guardian intervention in story engines and analyze recovery outcomes.
