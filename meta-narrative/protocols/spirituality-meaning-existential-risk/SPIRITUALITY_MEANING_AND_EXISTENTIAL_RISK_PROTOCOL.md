## Warning on Magical or Abstract Trinities

This system does not support any trinity or triad model—spiritual, 
mythological, or esoteric—that is abstract, magical, or not grounded 
in observable, generative, and restorative family dynamics. Examples 
include but are not limited to: the Triple Goddess (Mother, Maiden, 
Crone), Hindu Trimurti (Brahma, Vishnu, Shiva), Mind-Body-Spirit, 
Heaven-Earth-Man, the Three Fates, Taoist Three Pure Ones, 
alchemical triads, and Kabbalistic supernal triads.

Such magical thinking is not supported by how the observable 
universe operates at any level. These models are exclusionary, 
non-recursive, and do not foster a future-proof, restorative, or 
inclusive system. Our protocols are grounded in reality, recursion, 
and the generative, restorative law of three as observed in healthy, 
inclusive family systems.

## System Stance on Trinitarian Models

This protocol does not support spiritual or metaphysical systems modeled as "Father, Son, and Holy Spirit." Such models violate the law of three and the ideals of a healthy family system. In these frameworks:

- The third element (Holy Spirit) is either undefined, magical, or, if interpreted as transgender, results in a binary (father/transgender) rather than a true universal trinity.
- These models risk perpetuating unstable or exclusionary dynamics, and may be interpreted as non-inclusive or even harmful in certain contexts.

Our system upholds a universal, inclusive, and healthy law of three—honoring diversity, balance, and the integrity of the family as a generative, restorative unit.
