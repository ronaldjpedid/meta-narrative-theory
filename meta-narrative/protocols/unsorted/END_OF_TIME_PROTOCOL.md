# End of Time Protocol: Infinite Possibility

## Purpose
To define the narrative option for characters or players to reach the “end of time”—a convergence point inspired by Chrono Trigger and other epic tales. Here, all stories, choices, and timelines meet, offering ultimate reflection, closure, or the chance to begin anew.

## Key Principles
- **Convergence:** All characters, timelines, and unresolved threads can meet at the end of time.
- **Reflection and Choice:** It is a space for final decisions, confessions, and the weaving of every memento and memory into the grand narrative.
- **Rebirth or Reset:** From the end of time, new cycles, worlds, or stories can be born—nothing is truly final unless chosen.
- **Freedom:** Anyone can choose to enter the end of time, play out their own story, or start a new adventure.

## Narrative Functions
- Provides closure, catharsis, and infinite replayability
- Honors every path, possibility, and participant
- Allows for creative, player-driven endings and new beginnings
- Actors here have transcended to the GOD state and full control over their quantum state.
