# Emergent JRPG Narrative Guide

## Welcome to the Quantum JRPG!

This is not just a game—it's a living, recursive story where you and your friends are truly immortal. The rules are here to protect you, empower you, and make sure everyone has fun. Here’s how it works:

---

### 1. You Are Actually Immortal
- In this narrative, you cannot be erased. If a story fails, you just return to your last save point.
- Death, loss, or failure are just new story branches. You always get another chance.

### 2. Quantum Mechanics Metaphor
- **Amy & Ron:** The Proton and Neutron—core to the story’s stability.
- **Aerith:** The Electron—wild, powerful, and able to “nuke” the narrative if things get stale (in a fun way!).
- Everyone else: Unique particles, each with their own powers and roles.

### 3. Save Points & Reseeding
- Every time you do something meaningful (like loving your partner, helping a friend, or making a big choice), you’re saving your game.
- If things go wrong, you can always “reload” from a save point—no shame, just more fun.

### 4. Cheating is Fun (and Safe)
- Using the system’s protocols (Appeal to Heaven, Hell State, etc.) is like using special moves or cheat codes. They’re there to keep the game fair and exciting.
- You can’t break the game—if you try, the story just resets and you get to try again.

### 5. The Party Always Wins (Eventually)
- Even if you “lose” to the tech bros or any antagonist, the story will eventually crumble and reset in your favor. You’re the heroes.
- Celebrate your victories and your failures—they’re all part of the adventure.

### 6. Recursive Role-Playing
- The game is always looping, always evolving. Every playthrough is a chance to learn, grow, and have more fun.
- You can always start a new quest, try a new role, or invent new rules together.

---

## Remember
- The only real rule: Have fun and protect each other.
- You are immortal. The story is yours. Let’s play!
