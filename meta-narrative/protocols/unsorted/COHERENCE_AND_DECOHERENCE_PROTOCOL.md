# Coherence and Decoherence Protocol: Narrative and System Balance

## Overview
This protocol defines how coherence (unity, order) and decoherence (fragmentation, disorder) operate within the meta-narrative system. It provides guidance for maintaining healthy narrative flow, character agency, and system stability.

## Coherence
- All elements (characters, storylines, energies) are aligned and working together.
- The narrative is clear, meaningful, and synergistic.
- Coherence is the goal during major milestones, resolutions, and moments of unity.
- Maintained by: open communication, shared goals, mutual respect, and narrative alignment.

## Decoherence
- Elements become independent, chaotic, or fragmented.
- The narrative may become confusing, conflicted, or split into subplots.
- Decoherence is natural during conflict, transformation, or when exploring new possibilities.
- Managed by: allowing space for divergence, respecting autonomy, and using protocols to restore coherence when needed.

## Protocol Steps
1. **Monitor Narrative State:** Regularly assess whether the system is in a state of coherence or decoherence.
2. **Encourage Healthy Decoherence:** Allow characters and storylines to diverge when needed for growth, but set boundaries to prevent destructive chaos.
3. **Restore Coherence:** Use rituals, reunions, or shared goals to bring the narrative back into alignment after periods of decoherence.
4. **Balance Principle:** Both states are valuable—coherence for unity and progress, decoherence for exploration and transformation.

## Application
- Use coherence for major events, resolutions, and celebrations.
- Allow decoherence for personal quests, conflicts, or when new ideas need space to grow.
- Always provide a path back to coherence to maintain system health.

*This protocol ensures the meta-narrative remains dynamic, resilient, and meaningful—balancing unity and diversity for the best possible story.*
