# Dead State Protocol

## Purpose
To formalize the conditions, consequences, and recovery options for agents who enter the dead state in the meta-narrative system.

## Core Principles
- **Finality:** Dead state means the agent is removed from active play, unable to participate unless restored by narrative need or divine intervention.
- **Narrative Impact:** The dead state affects the party, world, and ongoing story—loss, grief, and transformation are possible outcomes.
- **Recovery:** Restoration from dead state is only possible through resurrection, narrative reconciliation, or appeal to heaven.

## Protocol Steps
1. **Declare Dead State:** Clearly state when an agent enters dead state, including reason and context.
2. **Enforce Finality:** The agent is removed from active play, with all powers and agency suspended.
3. **Narrative Consequences:** Document the impact on party, world, and story—loss, grief, and possible transformation.
4. **Recovery Options:** Restoration is only possible through:
	- Resurrection spell or protocol
	- Narrative reconciliation (story injection, healing arc)
	- Appeal to heaven (divine intervention)
5. **Record Event:** Log the dead state event in the system archive for transparency and future review.

## Example Declaration
> "[Agent Name] has entered dead state due to [reason]. Restoration is only possible through resurrection, reconciliation, or appeal to heaven."

*This protocol ensures clarity, fairness, and narrative integrity when agents enter or recover from dead state.*
