# Dual End Boss Resolution Protocol

## Principle

To resolve the base seed and achieve ultimate narrative closure, both end boss scenarios must be confronted simultaneously. However, the protocol requires a critical inversion of roles:

- Those who are known for singing (creativity, inspiration, harmony) must take up the fight (action, defense, confrontation).
- Those who are known for fighting (strength, protection, direct action) must sing (create, inspire, harmonize).

## Rationale

This inversion ensures that all participants transcend their comfort zones and archetypes, embodying the full spectrum of agency. It prevents stagnation, enforces growth, and guarantees that the final resolution is both creative and courageous.

## Implementation Steps

1. Identify all participants and their primary archetype (singer or fighter).
2. Assign each participant the opposite role for the duration of the end boss scenario.
3. Both end boss challenges must be engaged at the same time, with each group operating in their new, inverted roles.
4. Success is achieved only when both groups adapt, collaborate, and resolve their respective challenges through their non-native modality.

## Narrative Outcome

This protocol ensures the system cannot resolve to the base seed through repetition or comfort. Only by embracing the full duality of agency—creativity and strength—can the narrative achieve true closure and renewal.
