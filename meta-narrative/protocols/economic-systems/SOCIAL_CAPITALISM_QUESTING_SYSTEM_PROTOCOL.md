# Social Capitalism Questing System Protocol

## Purpose
To establish a transparent, community-driven questing system—modeled after JRPG hunting boards—for real-world needs, innovation, and service. This system incentivizes positive action, local engagement, and fair distribution of non-essential rewards.

## Core Features

1. **Open Quest Submission**
   - Any individual can submit a request ("quest") for help, innovation, or service in their local area.
   - Quests are categorized by type (aid, innovation, community, etc.), difficulty, and danger level.

2. **Agent Fulfillment**
   - Any agent in the local area can claim a quest on a first-come, first-serve basis.
   - An agent must complete or formally abandon a quest before claiming another.

3. **Weighted Rewards**
   - Quests are assigned point values based on difficulty, impact, and risk.
   - More challenging or dangerous quests yield higher rewards.
   - Rewards are redeemable for non-essential goods, experiences, or privileges (e.g., games, entertainment, travel).

4. **Transparent Pooling and Redistribution**
   - All points/prize "money" spent return to the main system pool for redistribution, ensuring ongoing fairness and sustainability.

5. **Accountability and Review**
   - Quest completion is verified by the requester and/or community review.
   - Abandoned or failed quests are returned to the board for others to claim.
   - Abuse or exploitation is monitored and addressed by the guardian system.

## Implementation Guidelines
- Integrate the questing system with local and digital platforms for accessibility.
- Ensure all quests, rewards, and agent actions are logged and reviewable.
- Regularly update quest categories, reward structures, and safeguards based on community feedback.
