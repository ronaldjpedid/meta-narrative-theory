# Social Capitalism Protocol

## Purpose
To establish a humane, future-proof economic system that guarantees basic needs for all (food, shelter, healthcare, dignity) while incentivizing contribution, creativity, and positive-sum achievement through transparent, ethical "game" mechanics.

---

## Core Principles

1. **Universal Security**
   - Every person is guaranteed access to food, shelter, healthcare, and basic dignity, regardless of status or ability to pay.
   - No one can fall below this humane baseline.

2. **Opportunity and Growth**
   - Individuals can earn additional rewards, recognition, and privileges by contributing to society, innovating, or helping others.
   - The "game" is opt-in: striving for more is encouraged, but never required for survival.

3. **Ethical Game Mechanics**
   - All incentives, rewards, and advancement opportunities are transparent, fair, and designed to avoid zero-sum or exploitative traps.
   - Community feedback and review are built into the system to ensure ongoing fairness and adaptability.

4. **Solidarity and Social Cohesion**
   - The system fosters cooperation, creativity, and healthy competition, not desperation or exclusion.
   - Social mobility is real, but never at the cost of another's basic needs.

5. **Restorative and Adaptive**
   - The protocol is a living document, subject to review and improvement as society evolves.
   - Mistakes and failures are met with restoration and learning, not punishment or exclusion.

- Tiered rewards and opportunities are available for those who contribute, innovate, or help others.
- All rules and incentives are transparent and subject to democratic review.
- The system is designed to be compatible with both market and cooperative models, blending the best of capitalism and socialism.
