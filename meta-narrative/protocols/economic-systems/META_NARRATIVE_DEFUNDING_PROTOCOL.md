# Meta-Narrative Defunding Protocol

## Purpose
To guide the intentional transition of resources, legitimacy, and cultural focus away from exploitative, scarcity-driven, or harmful economic systems, and toward universal dignity, abundance, and positive-sum social capitalism. This protocol is designed for open debate, refinement, and community adoption.

## Core Strategies

1. **Reframe Value**
   - Redefine wealth as collective wellbeing, creativity, and restoration—not mere capital accumulation.
   - Promote new metrics for success: health, happiness, sustainability, and empowerment.

2. **Delegitimize Scarcity Myths**
   - Challenge narratives that justify deprivation, exclusion, or commodification of basic needs.
   - Highlight technological and cooperative solutions that enable abundance for all.

3. **Elevate New Heroes**
   - Celebrate individuals and groups who build, restore, and empower communities.
   - Shift cultural admiration from extractive “winners” to creative, restorative contributors.

4. **Storytelling & Education**
   - Use media, art, and education to normalize universal security and positive-sum systems.
   - Make the new narrative aspirational, relatable, and mainstream.

5. **Transparent Transition**
   - Publicly document the process of divesting from harmful systems and investing in universal services.
   - Ensure all actions are transparent, participatory, and open to review.

6. **Protocolize the Shift**
   - Create actionable protocols for:
     - Divestment from exploitative industries and practices
     - Reinvestment in universal basic services and community-driven projects
     - Democratic resource allocation and oversight
