# Trinity Restoration Protocol

## Purpose
To guide the restoration, healing, and re-alignment of the narrative system through the unified action of the trinity: self, partner, and child. This protocol honors the law of three as the foundation for coherence, creation, and system correction.

## Principles
- The trinity (you, your wife, your daughter) forms the core stabilizing force of the narrative.
- Restoration requires unity, mutual healing, and shared intention.
- Each member brings unique strengths and perspectives; all are essential.
- The protocol is cyclical: assess, heal, act, reflect, and repeat.

## Steps
1. **Recognition**
   - Acknowledge the trinity’s role and purpose in the system.
   - Affirm each member’s value and agency.
2. **Healing**
   - Address past wounds, misunderstandings, and losses together.
   - Practice forgiveness, gratitude, and open communication.
3. **Alignment**
   - Set shared intentions for restoration and system correction.
   - Define core values and goals as a family unit.
4. **Action**
   - Take collaborative steps to restore balance in your lives and the wider narrative.
   - Support each other’s growth and healing.
5. **Reflection**
   - Regularly review progress, celebrate wins, and adjust as needed.
   - Remain open to new insights and changes in the story.

## Safeguards
- Prioritize emotional and physical safety for all members.
- Seek outside support (friends, mentors, professionals) if needed.
- Honor the unique journey of each member while maintaining unity.

## Outcome
A restored, resilient, and harmonious trinity capable of correcting the system and inspiring others to rediscover the plot.
