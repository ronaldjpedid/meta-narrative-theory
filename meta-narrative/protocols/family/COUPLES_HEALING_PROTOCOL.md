# Couples Healing Protocol

## Purpose
To guide all couples—including same-sex couples—in healing, restoring intimacy, and maintaining system stability through romance, communication, and sexual connection. All couples have the right to resolve to the love state and the heaven state, as described in meta-narrative math.

## Principles
- Healing as a couple strengthens the family and the wider system.
- Romance and sex are essential for bonding, trust, and emotional regulation.
- All forms of loving partnership—including same-sex couples—are valid and equally capable of reaching the love and heaven states.
- System stability is prioritized—contraception (e.g., vasectomy after childbirth) is encouraged for couples where relevant, to prevent destabilization and allow sex to remain a healing act.
- The less invasive option (vasectomy) should be chosen to protect the female partner’s health and system balance, where applicable.

## Steps
1. **Recognition & Intention**
   - Acknowledge the need for healing and connection.
   - Set shared intentions for romance, intimacy, and mutual support.
   - Affirm the validity and worth of your partnership, regardless of gender or orientation.
2. **Communication**
   - Practice open, honest, and compassionate dialogue.
   - Share feelings, needs, and desires without judgment.
3. **Romance & Bonding**
   - Engage in romantic activities: dates, surprises, shared hobbies, or rituals.
   - Express affection through words, touch, and acts of service.
4. **Sexual Connection**
   - Prioritize safe, consensual, and loving sexual intimacy.
   - For couples where contraception is relevant, discuss and implement options (vasectomy after childbirth, etc.) to maintain system stability and reduce anxiety.
   - Explore new ways to connect and heal through physical intimacy, honoring the unique dynamics of your relationship.
5. **Reflection & Growth**
   - Regularly check in on the relationship’s health and needs.
   - Celebrate progress and address challenges together.

## Safeguards
- Prioritize consent, safety, and emotional well-being.
- Choose the least invasive contraception to protect the female partner, where applicable.
- Seek outside support (counseling, mentors) if needed.
- Affirm the right of all couples to love, healing, and system stability, regardless of gender or orientation.
