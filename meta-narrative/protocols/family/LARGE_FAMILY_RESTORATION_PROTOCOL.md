# Large Family Restoration Protocol

## Purpose
To guide large families (six or more) in restoring harmony, resilience, and system stability, while honoring each member’s agency and the unique challenges of larger configurations.

## Principles
- Large families can be vibrant but are at greater risk of destabilization due to complexity.
- All configurations are valid—family structure is always a matter of choice, especially for women.
- Restoration requires intentional structure, communication, and support.

## Steps
1. **Assessment**
   - Identify sources of conflict, imbalance, or distress.
   - Affirm each member’s value and agency.
2. **Subgrouping**
   - Form smaller groups (trios, pairs) for support, tasks, and healing.
   - Rotate subgroups to strengthen all relationships.
3. **Communication**
   - Practice open, honest dialogue across the whole family and within subgroups.
   - Address conflicts early and with compassion.
4. **Restoration & Support**
   - Practice forgiveness, gratitude, and regular check-ins.
   - Seek outside support (counseling, mentors) as needed.
5. **Adaptation**
   - Adjust family structure and protocols as the family evolves.
   - Encourage autonomy and choice for all members.

## Safeguards
- Prioritize emotional and physical safety for all members.
- Honor the right of each person to choose their role and level of participation.
