# Self Healing Protocol

## Purpose
To provide a structured, compassionate process for self-soothing, healing, and restoration when the party or support system is unavailable.

## Principles
- Self-healing is a vital skill for resilience and autonomy.
- Compassion, patience, and non-judgment are essential.
- The protocol is cyclical: assess, soothe, reflect, and repeat as needed.

## Steps
1. **Recognition**
   - Acknowledge your need for healing and support.
   - Affirm your worth and right to self-care.
2. **Grounding**
   - Use breathwork, mindfulness, or grounding exercises to stabilize emotions.
   - Engage the senses: touch, sound, sight, smell, taste.
3. **Self-Soothing**
   - Practice gentle self-talk, affirmations, or journaling.
   - Engage in comforting activities: music, art, nature, movement, or rest.
4. **Reflection**
   - Identify triggers, patterns, and needs.
   - Set intentions for ongoing healing and growth.
5. **Recovery**
   - If distress persists, seek outside support when possible.
   - Celebrate small victories and progress.

## Safeguards
- Avoid self-criticism or harsh judgment.
- Prioritize safety and basic needs (food, rest, hydration).
- If overwhelmed, reach out to trusted allies or professionals.
