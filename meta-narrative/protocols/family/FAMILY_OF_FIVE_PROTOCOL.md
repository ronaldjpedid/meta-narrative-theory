# Family of Five Protocol

## Purpose
To guide families of five in maintaining harmony, resilience, and system stability, while honoring each member’s unique role and the complexity of larger configurations.

## Principles
- Five-member families can be stable but require intentional structure and communication.
- Subgroups (trios, pairs) can help maintain balance and prevent isolation.
- The protocol is cyclical: assess, heal, act, reflect, and repeat.

## Steps
1. **Alignment**
   - Affirm each member’s value and role.
   - Set shared intentions and family values.
2. **Communication**
   - Practice open, honest dialogue.
   - Address conflicts early and with compassion.
3. **Subgrouping & Collaboration**
   - Form trios and pairs for tasks, support, and growth.
   - Rotate subgroups to strengthen all relationships.
4. **Restoration**
   - Practice forgiveness, gratitude, and regular check-ins.
   - Seek outside support if needed.

## Safeguards
- Prioritize emotional and physical safety.
- Adapt the protocol as the family evolves.
