# High Achiever Recognition Protocol

## Purpose
To honor agents who reach the wealth cap or achieve extraordinary contributions, provided their actions are non-exploitative and benefit the system or society.

## Principles
- High achievers are celebrated for positive impact, innovation, and service—not just accumulation.
- Exploitative achievement is not honored and is subject to justice and restitution.
- Remembrance and honor are given through awards, stories, and monuments.

## Steps
1. **Achievement Review**
   - All high achievements are reviewed for fairness, impact, and non-exploitative conduct.
   - Exploitative achievements are disqualified and subject to justice.
2. **Recognition & Remembrance**
   - Honorees are celebrated through awards, stories, statues, and community events.
   - Their legacy is preserved in the system’s history and culture.
3. **Restorative Justice**
   - If exploitation is discovered, titles and honors are revoked, and resources are returned to victims or society.

## Safeguards
- Transparent, participatory review and feedback.
- Regular updates to recognition systems and protocols.
