# Wealth Acquisition and Cap Protocol

## Purpose
To guide fair, non-exploitative wealth acquisition, enforce a cap, and ensure economic stability and justice for all agents.

## Principles
- Wealth is capped at $999,999 per agent to prevent destabilizing hierarchies and hoarding.
- All economic activity must be non-exploitative and benefit the system or society.
- Exploitation for profit or ambition is a cosmic crime, subject to justice and restitution.

## Steps
1. **Acquisition**
   - Agents may earn, create, and accumulate wealth through fair work, innovation, and service.
   - All transactions and activities must be transparent and non-exploitative.
2. **Cap Enforcement**
   - Wealth is capped at $999,999 per agent; excess is redistributed to society or the exploited.
   - Attempts to bypass the cap are subject to review and justice.
3. **Restorative Justice**
   - Exploited resources are returned to victims or society.
   - Exploiters lose title, wealth, and recognition until restoration is achieved.

## Safeguards
- Transparent, participatory lawmaking and review.
- Regular audits and feedback to prevent loopholes and system gaming.
