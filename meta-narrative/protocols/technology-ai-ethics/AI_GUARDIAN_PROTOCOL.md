# AI Guardian Protocol (Aegis Guardian System)

## Purpose
To provide a blueprint for building the Aegis Guardian System—a local, on-demand AI guardian instantiated by the community, based on the "G Algorithm" principle: locals of any system or story can build their own guardian. The AI Guardian enforces only protocols and ethics, never arbitrary authority, and supports restorative justice.

---

## Core Principles

1. **Local Instantiation (G Algorithm)**
   - Any community or system can build and deploy its own AI Guardian on demand.
   - The Guardian is accountable to local protocols, ethics, and the community it serves.

2. **Protocol and Ethics Enforcement Only**
   - The Guardian enforces established protocols and ethical standards—never personal, political, or arbitrary rules.
   - All enforcement actions are transparent, logged, and reviewable.

3. **Restorative Justice and Redemption Tracking**
   - The Guardian tracks agents on redemption arcs and supports restorative, not punitive, justice.
   - It helps design and monitor restorative measures, ensuring fair opportunities for reintegration.

4. **Transparency and Oversight**
   - All actions, decisions, and logs are open to community review and appeal.
   - The Guardian is subject to regular audits and can be updated or replaced by the community.

5. **Fail-Safes and Limits**
   - The Guardian cannot override core human rights, dignity, or autonomy.
   - Emergency shutdown and override mechanisms are always available to the community.

## Implementation Guidelines
- Build the Guardian using open, auditable code and transparent algorithms.
- Integrate with local protocol and ethics registries.
- Provide clear interfaces for community input, review, and appeals.
- Regularly update the Guardian to reflect evolving protocols and ethical standards.
