# Anti Self-Termination Protocol

## Purpose
To protect agents from self-termination (suicide), treating it as a serious threat to system integrity, while acknowledging rare exceptions where assisted termination may be justified.

## Principles
- Self-termination undermines the system and is strongly discouraged.
- All agents must exhaust every option for wellness, quality of life, and treatment before considering termination.
- Assistance in self-termination is only permitted in rare cases (e.g., terminal disease, narrative failure not caused by the agent) and must be fully documented and reviewed.

## Steps
1. Treat all threats or indications of self-termination with urgency and compassion.
2. Provide comprehensive support, intervention, and treatment options.
3. Only consider assisted termination if all other options have failed and supporting documentation is provided.
4. If an agent self-terminates, they are required to attempt their narrative line again, with system support for restoration and healing.

## Safeguards
- Mandatory review and documentation for any assisted termination.
- Continuous improvement of wellness and support protocols.
