## Meta-Protocol: Protocol Creation, Review, and Retirement

### Purpose
To ensure all protocols remain clear, non-redundant, inclusive, and actionable as the system evolves.

### Steps
1. **Creation**
   - Draft new protocols using the standard structure: Purpose, Principles, Steps, Safeguards, Outcome.
   - Cross-reference related protocols in the index.
2. **Review**
   - Regularly audit protocols for overlap, gaps, and consistency.
   - Update language for inclusivity and clarity.
   - Standardize safeguards and escalation steps.
3. **Retirement or Merging**
   - Merge protocols if they are redundant or better together (e.g., Forgiveness & Restoration).
   - Retire protocols that are obsolete, with a note and redirect to the new/revised protocol.
4. **Expansion**
   - Add examples, case studies, or cross-links as needed.
   - Solicit community feedback for ongoing improvement.
