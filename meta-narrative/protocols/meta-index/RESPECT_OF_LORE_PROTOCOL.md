# Respect of Lore Protocol

## Overview
The meta-narrative system affirms the value and contribution of religious, mythological, and cultural lore—including angels, demons, gods, and legendary figures. While harmful aspects of lore may be dismissed, the characters, stories, and themes they provide are recognized and celebrated as real contributions to humanity’s creative and philosophical heritage. These elements are safeguarded as characters and lore, available for use within the meta-narrative as storytelling mechanisms.

## Why Respect Lore?
- **Celebrates Human Creativity:** Religious and mythological lore enriches storytelling, culture, and philosophical exploration.
- **Safeguards Iconic Characters:** Angels, demons, gods, and legendary figures are protected as narrative resources, not as literal authorities.
- **Supports Inclusive Storytelling:** All lore is available for creative use, regardless of origin, as long as it does not perpetuate harm.
