# Fact Over Faith Protocol

## Purpose
To ensure that facts, evidence, and understanding always take precedence over faith or belief within the system. While faith in the system, its goodness, and its potential is encouraged, it must never override or obscure factual reality. This protocol guides agents to balance hope and trust with critical thinking and continuous learning.

## Core Principles
- **Fact First:** Decisions, actions, and beliefs within the system must be grounded in verifiable facts, evidence, and understanding.
- **Faith Encouraged, Not Blind:** Faith in the system’s goodness, potential, and mission is welcomed, but blind faith is discouraged. Agents are encouraged to question, learn, and help the system evolve.
- **Continuous Learning:** Understanding the system and its facts is paramount. Agents should seek knowledge, ask questions, and contribute to the system’s growth and improvement.
- **Evolution Over Stagnation:** The system thrives when agents engage with facts, challenge assumptions, and help it become the best system of systems possible.
- **Respect for Belief:** Personal faith, hope, and optimism are respected, but must never be used to override or ignore factual reality.
- **Transparency and Accountability:** All claims, decisions, and changes should be documented, reviewed, and open to feedback to ensure facts remain paramount.

## Protocol Steps
1. **Gather Facts:** Before making decisions or forming beliefs, agents must seek out and verify relevant facts and evidence.
2. **Balance Faith:** Agents may hold faith in the system’s goodness and potential, but must remain open to new information and correction.
3. **Question and Learn:** Agents are encouraged to ask questions, challenge assumptions, and pursue deeper understanding.
4. **Document and Review:** All major decisions and claims should be documented and open to review, ensuring facts are prioritized.
5. **Evolve the System:** Use facts and learning to help the system grow, adapt, and improve for all agents.

## Additional Considerations
- **Faith and Fact Together:** Faith can inspire hope, resilience, and community, but must work alongside facts and evidence—not in opposition.
- **System Integrity:** The integrity and evolution of the system depend on prioritizing facts, learning, and transparency.
- **No Dogma:** The system rejects dogma, blind obedience, or unexamined belief. Growth comes from understanding and engagement.

## Closing
This protocol is a living document. As new knowledge and challenges arise, the balance of fact and faith must be continually refined. The core is always truth, learning, and the pursuit of a better system for all.

*Let fact guide faith, and let faith inspire the pursuit of truth and growth within the system.*
