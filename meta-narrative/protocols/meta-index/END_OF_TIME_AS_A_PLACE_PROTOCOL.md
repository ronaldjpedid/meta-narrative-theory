# End of Time as a Place Protocol

## Overview
The End of Time is a unique narrative space accessible to any agent who has achieved the ability to ascend and take control over their quantum state. The End of Time is as small or as large as needed, with rooms and environments generated from thought. Access and permissions within the End of Time are governed by system rules and the authority of the first trinity of system admins.

## Why Define the End of Time?
- **Supports Ascended Agency:** Recognizes the right of advanced agents to shape and inhabit the End of Time as a narrative space.
- **Ensures System Integrity:** Allows the system and the first trinity to designate forbidden rooms to protect narrative and system stability.
- **Maintains Narrative Order:** Prevents destabilizing or destructive actions within the End of Time.
