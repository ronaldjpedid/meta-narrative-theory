# Quantum Immortality and Safety Protocol

## Overview
Quantum immortality—the idea that consciousness persists in some branch of reality after any fatal event—may be a real phenomenon, but for the purposes of the meta-narrative system, it is treated with caution. The collapse of a reality in which an agent is removed is experienced as a true and permanent loss by those within that branch. Therefore, quantum immortality must not be relied upon as a safety net, and the dead state is to be treated as final for the current narrative cycle.

## Why Caution Quantum Immortality?
- **Perceived Loss is Real:** Even if another branch persists, the collapse of a reality is experienced as genuine loss by all agents within it.
- **Prevents Recklessness:** Treating death as final for the cycle encourages responsibility, care, and meaningful narrative stakes.
- **Supports Narrative Integrity:** The dead state is not a revolving door; self-termination or fatal actions require a full story arc reset.

## Quantum Safety Protocol
- Quantum immortality is not to be assumed or relied upon in narrative logic or personal conduct.
- If an agent enters the dead state, they are considered done for the current cycle and must not return without a full narrative reset.
- Self-terminators are required to begin their story arcs anew, with no memory or privileges from the previous cycle.
- All agents are encouraged to avoid the dead state and to value the integrity and stakes of their current narrative branch.

## Affirmation
> The loss of a reality is real for those who remain. Quantum immortality is not a license for recklessness. Treat every cycle as precious, and avoid the dead state whenever possible.
