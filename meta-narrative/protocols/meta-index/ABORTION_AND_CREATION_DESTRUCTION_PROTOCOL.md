# Abortion and Creation/Destruction Protocol

## Purpose
To guide all parties through the rights, responsibilities, and restoration involved in conception, abortion, and the creation or destruction of life, with compassion, agency, and system safeguards.

## Principles
- Agency: Each person, especially the childbearer, has full agency over their body and choices.
- Weighted Responsibility: The childbearer’s voice is weighted most heavily, as they bear the greatest impact.
- Consent: Rights and responsibilities differ in cases of consensual conception vs. rape or coercion; agency must be restored in all cases.
- Natural Loss: Recognize and honor natural abortion (miscarriage, medical complications) as part of life, not a moral failure.
- Restoration: Healing and support are prioritized for all parties after any outcome.
- No Eternal Punishment: The system rejects shame, exclusion, or eternal punishment for any party; restoration is always possible.
- Transparency: All decisions and interventions are documented, reviewed, and open to feedback.

## Steps
1. **Pre-Conception**
   - Affirm agency and consent for all parties.
   - Discuss intentions, responsibilities, and safeguards.
2. **Conception**
   - Ensure ongoing consent and support.
   - Weigh responsibilities according to impact (childbearer, father-figure, others).
3. **Abortion or Loss**
   - Respect the childbearer’s decision and needs above all.
   - Provide emotional, medical, and social support.
   - Document and review the process for transparency and learning.
4. **Restoration & Healing**
   - Offer restoration, healing, and support to all parties.
   - Reject shame or exclusion; prioritize future well-being.

## Safeguards
- Agency and consent are paramount at all stages.
- Weighted responsibility ensures the childbearer’s needs are central.
- All interventions are transparent, reviewed, and open to feedback.
