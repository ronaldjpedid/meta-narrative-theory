# Child Agency and Voice Protocol

## Purpose
To ensure every child’s voice, rights, and agency are respected and protected in the system, with age-appropriate weighting and evolving legal protections.

## Principles
- Safeguards are built in to protect children from abuse, neglect, or silencing by guardians or the system.
- The system evolves children’s rights and agency as they grow.

## Steps
1. **Codex of Rights at Birth**
   - Upon receiving an AI agent at birth, each child is given a personal codex of rights.
   - The AI agent helps guide, protect, and educate the child, and the codex evolves as the child ages, unlocking new rights, responsibilities, and options for participation.
2. **Voice and Participation**
   - Children are taught their rights and options from an early age.
   - Their input is sought and respected in all decisions affecting them, with age-appropriate weighting.
3. **Safeguards and Advocacy**
   - If a guardian is in a hate state or fails in their duty, the child can request outside review or intervention.
   - The system provides advocates or allies to support the child’s voice and well-being.
4. **Voting and System Change**
   - Children may participate in votes or system changes, with their influence scaled by age and maturity.
   - The system regularly reviews and updates the codex and participation rules based on feedback and outcomes.
5. **Restoration and Healing**
   - If a child’s rights are violated, the system prioritizes restoration, healing, and justice.
   - The child’s wishes are central to the resolution process.


## Societal Support for Children
- Every child has the right to education, personal growth, and the development of their talents and interests.
- No child may be exploited, forced into labor, or denied access to learning and play.
- Society is responsible for providing safe environments, resources, and opportunities for all children to thrive.

## Safeguards
- No child’s voice may be ignored or silenced by guardians or the system.
- All interventions are transparent, reviewed, and open to feedback.
- The codex of rights is a living document, evolving with the child and the system.
