# Transgender Child Protocol

## Purpose
To affirm and support transgender children in transitioning to the state of their choice, while honoring biological realities and ensuring dignity, inclusion, and future-proofed narrative logic.

## Principles
- Every child has the right to self-identify and transition to their chosen state.
- Biological sex is maintained for narrative/creation logic (e.g., child universes), but does not limit identity, dignity, or participation.
- Support, safety, and inclusion are paramount.

## Steps
1. **Affirmation**
   - Affirm the child’s identity and right to transition.
   - Use chosen names and pronouns.
2. **Support**
   - Provide emotional, social, and medical support as needed.
   - Educate family and community on inclusion and respect.
3. **Integration**
   - Honor both identity and biological realities in family and system roles.
   - Ensure the child’s participation in all aspects of family and community life.
4. **Restoration**
   - Address challenges with compassion and patience.
   - Seek outside support if needed.

## Safeguards
- Prioritize emotional and physical safety.
- Maintain the right to create (e.g., bear child universes) regardless of state.
- Adapt the protocol as the child grows and the system evolves.
