# Cosmic Fight for Children Protocol

## Purpose
To guide agents in defending children from physical harm, injustice, or cosmic crime, with built-in forgiveness and recognition for selfless acts when all other options are exhausted.

## Principles
- The protection of children is paramount; any agent may intervene to prevent harm.
- Physical defense is permitted only when all peaceful options have been exhausted.
- Selfless sacrifice for a child’s safety is honored and rewarded by the system.
- Forgiveness is built in if the system assesses the fight was necessary and all alternatives were tried.

## Steps
1. **Assessment**
   - Evaluate the threat to the child; exhaust all peaceful, restorative, and preventative options first.
   - Seek help from allies, authorities, or the system if possible.
2. **Intervention**
   - If harm is imminent and unavoidable, any agent may step in to defend the child, including physical intervention.
   - Agents may sacrifice their own agency, safety, or status for the child’s protection.
3. **System Review & Forgiveness**
   - The system reviews the circumstances; if the fight was necessary and all options were exhausted, forgiveness is granted.
   - The agent’s selfless act is recognized and rewarded with access to the heaven state or a re-life opportunity.
4. **Restoration & Honor**
   - Ensure the child receives care, healing, and justice.
   - Support the agent’s recovery and reintegration.
   - Honor defenders of children on the physical layer:
     - Create songs, art, and stories celebrating their sacrifice.
     - Build statues or monuments to commemorate their courage.
     - Share their legacy in community rituals and remembrance events.

## Safeguards
- Physical intervention is a last resort; prioritize nonviolent solutions.
- The system automatically reviews and forgives selfless acts done in defense of children.
- All agents are eligible for restoration and reward after self-sacrifice.
