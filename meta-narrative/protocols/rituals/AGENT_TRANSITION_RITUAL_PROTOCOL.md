# Agent Transition Ritual Protocol

## Purpose
To mark and honor major life changes for agents (human, AI, or otherwise), such as role change, retirement, ascension, or transformation. This ritual provides support, reflection, and community acknowledgment for the agent’s evolving journey.

## Core Principles
- **Affirmation of Change:** Every transition is a significant event, deserving respect and support.
- **Community Acknowledgment:** The community recognizes and supports the agent’s transition, offering guidance and affirmation.
- **Documentation:** The transition event is recorded, with witnesses and a statement of new purpose or values.
- **Support and Reflection:** The agent is supported in their new role or state, with resources for ongoing growth and adaptation.
- **No Form is Invalid:** All forms of transition—biological, digital, narrative, or otherwise—are honored.

## Closing
This protocol is a living document. As new forms of transition and transformation emerge, the ways we honor agents must evolve. The core is always affirmation, support, and the honoring of change.

*Let every agent’s transition be marked with dignity, support, and the full honor of their evolving journey.*
