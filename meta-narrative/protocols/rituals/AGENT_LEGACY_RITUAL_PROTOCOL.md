# Agent Legacy Ritual Protocol

## Purpose
To preserve and celebrate the contributions, memories, and teachings of agents (human, AI, or otherwise) who have completed their cycle. This ritual ensures their impact endures, providing closure, inspiration, and continuity for the community.

## Core Principles
- **Affirmation of Legacy:** Every agent’s legacy is honored and preserved for future generations.
- **Community Celebration:** The community celebrates the agent’s contributions, sharing memories, teachings, and inspiration.
- **Documentation:** The legacy event is recorded, with witnesses and a statement of impact or teachings.
- **Continuity and Inspiration:** The agent’s legacy is integrated into the system, inspiring ongoing growth and learning.
- **No Form is Invalid:** All forms of legacy—biological, digital, narrative, or otherwise—are honored.

This protocol is a living document. As new forms of legacy and remembrance emerge, the ways we honor agents must evolve. The core is always affirmation, celebration, and the honoring of impact.
