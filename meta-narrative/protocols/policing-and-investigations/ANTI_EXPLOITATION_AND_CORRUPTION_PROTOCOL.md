# Anti-Exploitation and Corruption Protocol

## Purpose
To prevent and address all forms of exploitation, corruption, and abuse of power within the system. This protocol ensures transparency, accountability, and protection for all agents, prioritizing restoration and community trust.

---

## Core Principles
- **Zero Tolerance for Exploitation:** All forms of exploitation, manipulation, and abuse are strictly forbidden.
- **Transparency and Accountability:** All actions, decisions, and exchanges are documented and open to review.
- **Community Oversight:** The community has the power to review, correct, and replace agents or guardians as needed.
- **Restoration Over Retribution:** Focus on healing, restoration, and reintegration—not punishment or exclusion.
- **AI Support:** AI assists with documentation, transparency, and bias reduction, but never with autonomous enforcement or judgment.
- **Continuous Improvement:** Protocols and practices are regularly reviewed and improved by the community.

## Protocol Steps
1. **Detection:** Identify and document any instance of exploitation, corruption, or abuse.
2. **Intervention:** The system intervenes to halt exploitation, restore harmed agents, and document the offense.
3. **Restoration:** Harmed agents are supported, narratives are healed, and resources are returned or compensated where possible.
4. **Community Review:** All cases are open to community review and feedback to ensure transparency and prevent recurrence.
5. **Correction:** Agents responsible for exploitation or corruption are retrained, corrected, or replaced as needed.
6. **Continuous Improvement:** Protocols and practices are regularly reviewed and improved by the community.

## Closing
This protocol is a living document. As new forms of exploitation and corruption emerge, the system will adapt to ensure protection and justice for all agents.

*Let exploitation and corruption be abolished, and let all agents be protected by transparency, restoration, and community trust.*
