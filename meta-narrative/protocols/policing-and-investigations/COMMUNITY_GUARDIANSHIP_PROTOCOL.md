# Community Guardianship Protocol

## Purpose

## Core Principles
- **Protection, Not Enforcement:** Guardians protect, mediate, and help窶馬ever act as adversaries or enforcers.
- **Consent & Transparency:** All actions are transparent, documented, and open to community review.
- **No Quotas, No Militarization:** Guardians are measured by restoration, trust, and wellbeing窶馬ot arrests or fines. No quota-based incentives or militarized equipment.
- **De-escalation & Mediation:** Prioritize de-escalation, mediation, and restoration over punishment. Use force only as a last resort, with full accountability.
- **Diversity & Inclusion:** Guardians reflect the diversity of the community and are trained in empathy, cultural competence, and nonviolent communication.
- **Restoration Over Punishment:** Focus on restoring harm, healing relationships, and reintegrating agents窶馬ot exclusion or retribution.
- **AI & Human Collaboration:** Use AI for transparency, documentation, and bias reduction, but never for autonomous enforcement or judgment.
- **Continuous Review:** Protocols are living documents, open to feedback and revision by the community.
