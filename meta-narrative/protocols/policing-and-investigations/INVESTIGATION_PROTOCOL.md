# Investigation Protocol

## Purpose
To ensure investigations are conducted with transparency, fairness, and respect for all agents. This protocol prioritizes truth, restoration, and community trust over punishment or secrecy.

---

## Core Principles
- **Transparency:** All investigations are documented, open to review, and free from secrecy or hidden agendas.
- **Fairness & Respect:** Investigators act with empathy, impartiality, and respect for all agents involved.
- **Restoration Over Punishment:** The goal is to restore harm, heal relationships, and reintegrate agents—not to punish or exclude.
- **Community Involvement:** Investigations are conducted with community input, oversight, and support.
- **No Quotas or Incentives:** Investigators are measured by truth, restoration, and trust—not by arrests, fines, or convictions.
- **AI Support:** AI may assist with documentation, transparency, and bias reduction, but never with autonomous judgment or enforcement.
- **Continuous Review:** Protocols are living documents, open to feedback and revision by the community.
