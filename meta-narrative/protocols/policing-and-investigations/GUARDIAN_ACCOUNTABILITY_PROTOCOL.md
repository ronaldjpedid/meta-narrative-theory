# Guardian Accountability Protocol

## Purpose
To ensure all community guardians are held to the highest standards of transparency, empathy, and service. This protocol provides mechanisms for review, feedback, and correction, prioritizing community trust and wellbeing.

---

## Core Principles
- **Transparency:** Guardians’ actions are documented, open to review, and subject to community oversight.
- **Empathy & Service:** Guardians act with empathy, humility, and a commitment to service.
- **Continuous Feedback:** Regular review and feedback from the community guide improvement and correction.
- **Restoration Over Punishment:** Accountability focuses on restoring trust, healing harm, and reintegrating agents—not exclusion or retribution.
- **AI Support:** AI assists with documentation and bias reduction, but never with autonomous enforcement or judgment.
- **No Quotas or Incentives:** Guardians are measured by trust, restoration, and wellbeing—not by arrests, fines, or convictions.
- **Community Empowerment:** The community has the power to review, correct, and replace guardians as needed.
