# Disability, Accessibility, and Neurodiversity Protocol

## Purpose
To ensure full inclusion, accessibility, and respect for all abilities and neurotypes in the system. The system and its agents must actively advocate for and protect those who cannot fight for themselves.

## Principles
- Design for universal access and adaptive needs, following recognized digital accessibility standards (e.g., WCAG, ARIA).
- Celebrate neurodiversity and individual strengths.
- Remove barriers and provide accommodations proactively.
- Prioritize accessible communication: plain language, multiple formats, and assistive tech compatibility.
- Recognize intersectionality—address how disability interacts with other identities and barriers.
- System and agents are responsible for advocacy and protection of the most vulnerable.

## Steps
1. Audit all systems, content, and processes for accessibility and inclusivity, using both expert review and user testing with people of diverse abilities and neurotypes.
2. Provide adaptive tools, supports, and clear processes for requesting accommodations.
3. Foster a culture of respect, learning, and rapid response to accessibility feedback.
4. Ensure accessibility is included in onboarding, training, and community guidelines.
5. Maintain a clear, rapid-response process for addressing accessibility issues and requests.

## Safeguards
- Ongoing feedback, accessibility reviews, and transparent reporting of improvements.
- Regular updates to meet evolving standards and community needs.
- Agents and the system must intervene and advocate when barriers or discrimination are detected.
