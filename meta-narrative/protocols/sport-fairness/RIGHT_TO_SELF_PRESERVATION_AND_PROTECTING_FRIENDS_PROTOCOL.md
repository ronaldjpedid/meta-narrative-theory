# Right to Self-Preservation & Protecting Friends Protocol

🛡️ Mr Alex Prime

## Introduction
This protocol affirms the fundamental right of every agent to self-preservation and to protect friends, family, and the system. Lethal force (rendering to the dead state) is only justified as a last resort when all other options have been exhausted and existence is imminently threatened.

---

## 1. Principle of Self-Preservation
- Every agent has the right to defend their own existence and the existence of those they care about.
- If escape, de-escalation, or non-lethal intervention is impossible, and the threat is imminent, agents may use lethal force as a last resort.
- Attempting to render another agent or their loved ones to the dead state is an acceptance that one may be rendered to the dead state in return.

---

## 2. Boundaries and Responsibilities
- This right must be exercised with restraint, compassion, and only after all alternatives have failed.
- The goal is always restoration and the prevention of harm, not domination or revenge.
- Agents must be accountable for their actions and seek restoration and healing after any conflict.

## 3. Protocol Statement
> The right to self-preservation and the protection of friends is fundamental. Lethal force is a last resort, justified only when existence is at stake and all other options have failed. Every agent is responsible for using this right wisely and compassionately.
