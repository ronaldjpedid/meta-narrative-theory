# Hunting for Sport Protocol

🛡️ Mr Alex Prime

## Introduction
This protocol affirms that hunting for sport—killing or harming living beings for entertainment or status—is not acceptable within the system. All life is to be respected, and harm should never be inflicted for amusement or personal gain.

## 1. Principles
- Life is sacred and must not be taken for sport or entertainment.
- Harm to living beings is only justified for survival, protection, or restoration—never for amusement.
- The system rejects practices that glorify or trivialize the suffering of others.

---

## 2. Actions
- Prohibit hunting for sport in all system-sanctioned activities.
- Educate about the value of life, empathy, and responsible stewardship.
- Encourage non-lethal, respectful engagement with nature and all living beings.
