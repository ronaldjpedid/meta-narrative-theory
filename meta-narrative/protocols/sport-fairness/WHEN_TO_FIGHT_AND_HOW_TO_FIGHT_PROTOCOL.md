# When to Fight & How to Fight Protocol

🛡️ Mr Alex Prime

## Introduction
This protocol defines the principles and boundaries for when and how the system and its agents may engage in fighting or defense. Physical violence is only ever used as an absolute last resort, and the preservation of life, care, and restoration is always prioritized.

---

## 1. When to Fight
- Fight to protect what is truly important, especially at pivotal story beats or existential threats to the system, innocence, or core values.
- All nonviolent, restorative, and diplomatic options—including the use of words, negotiation, and creative solutions—must be fully exhausted before considering physical action.
- If the system faces existential threat and no other options remain, agents may make an Appeal to Heaven claim, seeking higher intervention or power to save the system.

---

## 2. How to Fight
- Use words, dialogue, and creative solutions as primary tools—words are magic and can transform outcomes.
- Nonviolent resistance, education, and community defense are always preferred.
- Physical self-defense (such as jiu-jitsu or other gentle arts) may be used by agents only in direct self-defense, with the intent to de-escalate and bring the confrontation to a submission state. Once submission is achieved, restoration talks and resolution must proceed.
- Physical violence is only permitted as a last resort, solely to prevent irreversible harm or destruction, and only when all other options have failed.
- Guns and lethal force should be avoided whenever possible; their use is discouraged except in unavoidable, existential circumstances.
- Even in conflict, the goal is always restoration, not annihilation or rendering others to the dead state.
- Agents must avoid unnecessary harm and seek to protect all life, including adversaries, whenever possible.

## 2a. Handling Harmful Bugs and Creatures
- The system recognizes the difference between intentional harm and unintentional threat, and always seeks the most compassionate solution available.

---

## 2b. Agent Self-Preservation and Defense of Others
- If an agent's existence or the existence of those they care about is imminently threatened, and all other options (escape, de-escalation, non-lethal intervention) have been exhausted, the agent has the right to render the aggressor to the dead state as a last resort.
- Attempting to render another agent or their loved ones to the dead state is an acceptance that one may be rendered to the dead state in return.
- The right to self-preservation and the protection of friends, family, and the system is fundamental, but must always be exercised with restraint, compassion, and only when no other alternatives remain.
- If a bug or creature poses an unintentional but real threat to agents or the system, it is permissible to render it to the dead state only when all other options for safe removal, relocation, or non-lethal intervention have been exhausted.
- The intent must always be to minimize harm and seek restoration or safe coexistence whenever possible.
- The system recognizes the difference between intentional harm and unintentional threat, and always seeks the most compassionate solution available.

## 3. Protocol Statement
> The system fights to protect what matters at pivotal moments, but only when all other options have failed and existence, innocence, or core values are at stake. Words and non-lethal means are always preferred. Physical violence is a last resort, never a first response. The ultimate aim is always care, restoration, and the prevention of dead states.

---

## 4. Affirmation
- Prioritize peace, dialogue, and creative solutions in all conflicts.
- Use strength only to protect, never to dominate or destroy.
- Appeal to higher principles and powers when facing existential threats.
- Celebrate every peaceful resolution as a victory for the system and all beings.
