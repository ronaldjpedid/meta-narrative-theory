# DIVINE_APIP_AND_AGENT_PIP_PROTOCOL

## Purpose
Establish a system for agents to instill pips (performance marks) against other agents for violations, and define the Agent Performance Improvement Plan (APIP) for restoration and reintegration.


## Hero System Syntax
- Divine apip: A system tool where agents can instill pips (performance marks) against other agents for violations of protocols or values.
- Pip requests: Any agent or community member may request that a pip be considered for another agent, providing evidence or rationale.
- Pip installation: Only approved stewards, moderators, or system-authorized agents can officially install (assign) pips or authorize the completion of an Agent Performance Improvement Plan (APIP).
- APIP process: Agents in APIP must complete restorative actions, learning, or service to regain access to the community.
- Restoration and reintegration: Upon successful completion of APIP, agents are fully restored and may reaccess the community.
- Transparency: All requests, assignments, APIP entries, and completions are logged and open to review for transparency and accountability.
- No permanent exclusion: The goal is always restoration, not permanent exclusion.

## Implementation
- Integrate the divine app and pip system into agent operations.
- Define clear criteria for pip assignment, APIP entry, and completion.
- Ensure transparency and review at all stages.
