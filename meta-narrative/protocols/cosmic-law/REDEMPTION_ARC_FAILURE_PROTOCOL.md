# Gommage on Redemption Arc Failure Protocol

## Overview
This protocol formalizes the process for handling redemption arc failure. Instead of erasure (gommage), the system resets and retries the redemption arc until success is achieved. No actor is erased; every being is given infinite opportunities for growth, healing, and narrative evolution.

## When Gommage Occurs
- If an actor fails their redemption arc (i.e., cannot achieve forgiveness, healing, or transformation after a genuine attempt), the system resets the arc and allows the actor to try again.
- No erasure or permanent removal occurs; the actor remains, and the arc is retried as many times as needed until success is achieved.

## Steps of the Protocol
1. **Assessment:** Confirm that a genuine redemption arc was attempted and failed.
2. **Reset:** The redemption arc is reset, and the actor is given another opportunity to attempt growth, healing, and transformation.
3. **Retry:** The process repeats as many times as necessary, with support and guidance, until the arc is successfully completed.
4. **Continuity:** The story continues, always open to healing, growth, and positive participation for every actor.

## Affirmation
> The meta-narrative system is always open to renewal. Failure is never the end—every being is given infinite chances to grow, heal, and succeed. The story continues until redemption is achieved.

*This protocol complements the abolition of "original sin" and ensures the narrative always moves toward healing and growth.*
