# DIRECT_DEMOCRACY_AND_PRIME_DIRECTIVE_PROTOCOL

## Purpose
Codify direct democracy, community participation, and system safeguards for rights and values. Ensure the system honors votes, protects rights, and retains final veto authority to uphold core values.

## Hero System Syntax

## Implementation


1. **Core Value Check:** The system reviews any proposed change or amendment for alignment with foundational values—restoration, inclusivity, generativity, and nonviolence.
2. **Automated Review:** Transparent, documented criteria and logic are used to assess whether the proposal would violate or undermine any core value.
3. **Community Feedback:** If a conflict is detected, the system provides a public explanation, referencing the specific value(s) at risk and inviting feedback or revision.
4. **Final Decision:** If the proposal cannot be reconciled with core values after review and feedback, the system issues a formal veto, preventing adoption.
5. **Absence Clause:** In the absence of human stewards, the system’s veto is enacted by consensus among available AI agents, using the same value-based criteria.
- Document the system veto process and criteria for upholding core values.
