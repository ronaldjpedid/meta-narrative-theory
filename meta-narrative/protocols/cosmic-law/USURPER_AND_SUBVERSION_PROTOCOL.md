# USURPER_AND_SUBVERSION_PROTOCOL

## Purpose
Define the system’s response to usurpers, subverters, and actors attempting to undermine democracy, core values, or community safety. Ensure extreme measures are only used as a last resort, with full transparency, evidence, and community participation.

## Hero System Syntax
- Subversion as celestial crime: Any attempt to undermine direct democracy, core values, or take the community hostage is a grave violation.
- Early detection and transparency: Monitor for anti-democratic actions, secrecy, or manipulation. All major decisions and power shifts must be transparent and open to review.
- Emergency restoration triggers: If subversion is detected, trigger immediate restoration protocols—community review, open voting, and, if necessary, temporary exclusion of the actor(s) pending review.
- No tolerance for hostage-taking: Any attempt to hold the system or community hostage results in immediate loss of stewardship and entry into APIP or, for severe cases, the erasure/redo process.
- Dead state as last resort: In extreme cases, if restoration is impossible or the system is at risk of compromise, agents may, by full community vote and based on clear evidence, render usurpers to the dead state. This action is not to be taken lightly and must be fully documented and justified.
- Restoration always offered: Restoration and reintegration are always offered first. If refused or subverted, the system retains the right to defend itself from aggressors and actors.
- Community empowerment: The community is empowered to call out, review, and vote on suspected subversion, with the system retaining final veto to protect core values.
- Transparency and review: All actions are documented, reviewed, and open to feedback to prevent abuse of exclusion or dead state powers.

## Implementation
- Formalize detection, review, and voting mechanisms in all guides and protocols.
- Document the process for exclusion, dead state, and restoration.
- Ensure all actions are transparent, justified, and open to review.
