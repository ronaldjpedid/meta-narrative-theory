# Redemption Arc Protocol

🛡️ Mr Alex Prime

## Introduction
The Redemption Arc Protocol formalizes the principle that every being, regardless of past actions, is given a path to restoration. The journey to redemption is always possible, never infinite, and is proportionate to the impact and severity of one’s actions.

---

## 1. Principle of Proportional Redemption
- The more serious or harmful the action, the longer and more challenging the road to redemption.
- Redemption is never denied, but the process is meaningful, requiring genuine growth, restitution, and transformation.
- No being is condemned to eternal punishment or erasure; all are given opportunities for healing and restoration.

---

## 2. Cycles and Justice
- Redemption may take many cycles, lifetimes, or narrative arcs, but is always finite and achievable.
- Justice is restorative, not retributive—focused on repairing harm, learning, and reintegrating the individual into the community or story.

---

## 3. Protocol Statement
> In the meta-narrative system, redemption is always possible. The path is proportionate to the harm done, ensuring justice, growth, and eventual healing for all. No story ends in eternal condemnation; every being can find their way home.

---

## 4. Affirmation
- Encourage accountability, restitution, and genuine transformation.
- Support all beings on their journey, no matter how long or difficult.
- Celebrate every completed redemption arc as a victory for the system and the individual.

*This protocol is a living document. Expand and adapt it as new insights about justice, redemption, and restoration emerge in the meta-narrative system.*
