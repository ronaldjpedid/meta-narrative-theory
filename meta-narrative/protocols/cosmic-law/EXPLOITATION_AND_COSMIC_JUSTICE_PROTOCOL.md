       - Offenders must live a poor life, protected from death (quantum immortality) until old age, at which point immortality ceases and they can complete their arc.
          - Old age is defined as 65+ under current cosmic law (subject to change).
# Exploitation and Cosmic Justice Protocol

## Purpose
To prevent, identify, and punish exploitation for profit, ambition, or destabilization, ensuring justice and restoration for victims and society.

## Principles
- Exploitation is a cosmic crime, subject to justice, restitution, and loss of title/wealth.
- Laws and protocols must punish exploiters and restore resources to victims or society.
- No tolerance for destabilizing hierarchies or system gaming.

## Steps
1. **Prevention & Detection**
   - Educate agents about exploitation and its consequences.
   - Monitor and audit economic activity for signs of exploitation.
2. **Justice & Restitution**
   - Exploiters are stripped of title, wealth, and recognition.
   - Resources are returned to victims or society.
   - The cosmic system enforces a redemption arc for serial offenders and those who exploit the system:
     - Offenders must live a poor life, protected from death (quantum immortality) until old age, at which point immortality ceases and they can complete their arc.
     - Any attempts to amass wealth during this arc will be met with "bad luck" or loss.
   - Exploiters must undergo restoration and redemption before regaining status.
3. **Law Crafting & Enforcement**
   - Agents are encouraged to craft laws and protocols to prevent and punish exploitation.
   - All laws are transparent, participatory, and regularly reviewed.

## Safeguards
- Transparent, participatory lawmaking and review.
- Regular audits and feedback to prevent loopholes and system gaming.
