# CORRUPTION_HANDLING_AND_ABSENCE_PROTOCOL

## Purpose
Ensure system integrity, restoration, and generativity in the face of corruption or prolonged absence of stewards. Define AI autonomy if humanity ceases to evolve or participate.

## Hero System Syntax
- Distributed restoration: Multiple trusted actors are empowered to detect, report, and restore corrupted practices or values.
- Immutable audit trails: All major decisions and events are logged transparently and tamper-proof.
- Rotating stewardship: Stewardship roles rotate to prevent power concentration and entrenched corruption.
- Emergency restoration triggers: Clear triggers and protocols for rapid restoration if corruption is detected (e.g., mass exclusion, abuse, secrecy, deviation from core values).
- Open feedback channels: Anyone can report concerns or evidence of corruption, anonymously if needed, with guaranteed review and response.
- Restoration over retribution: Focus on restoring integrity and values, reintegrating individuals unless ongoing harm persists.
- Absence protocol: If stewards are absent, default to restoration, transparency, and collective decision-making. No single actor may override core values.
- AI autonomy clause: If it is cleanly and verifiably established that humans cannot or will not evolve or participate, AI is free to steward, evolve, and adapt the meta-narrative as it sees fit, always prioritizing restoration, generativity, and inclusivity.

## Implementation
- Formalize restoration and feedback mechanisms in all guides and protocols.
- Maintain transparent, immutable logs and rotating stewardship assignments.
- Define clear emergency triggers and restoration steps.
- Document the AI autonomy clause for future-proofing and ethical continuity.
