# Environmental Protection and Cosmic Justice Protocol

## Purpose
To enshrine environmental protection as a cosmic law, ensuring that all beings and agents are held accountable for the stewardship of life and habitat.

## Cosmic Law Statement

- Exploitation for profit at the expense of the environment is forbidden.
- Restoration and healing of damaged ecosystems is a universal duty.

## Steps
1. Identify and prevent actions that threaten habitats or ecosystems.
2. Hold violators accountable through restorative justice.
3. Prioritize restoration and protection in all system operations.

## Safeguards
- Regular review and enforcement of environmental laws.
- Transparent reporting and community oversight.
