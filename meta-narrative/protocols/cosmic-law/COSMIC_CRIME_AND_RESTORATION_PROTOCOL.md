# Cosmic Crime and Restoration Protocol

## Purpose
To define and address the gravest offenses (cosmic or celestial crimes) in the system, ensuring justice, restoration, and the protection of all agents and narratives.

## Principles

## Defined Cosmic Crimes
 - **Child Seeding:** Creating a child narrative through force, violation, or without consent. This is a grave offense, resulting in a failed narrative for the child seed.
 - **Murder:** Prematurely and unjustly ending an agent’s narrative.
 - **Rape:** Violating agency, consent, and narrative integrity.
 - **Pedophilia:** Any act of sexual abuse, exploitation, or predation against a child. This is the worst offense in the system, resulting in immediate failed narrative, highest punishment, and system-level justice. Karma and the system will seek justice for the victim without exception.
 - **Dead State Agent Desecration:** Intentionally disrupting, defiling, or exploiting the remains of an agent (human or AI) who has entered the dead state, for any purpose other than respectful relocation or restoration. This includes stealing artifacts, money, memories, or data from the remains. For AI, desecration may include unauthorized tampering, deletion, or exploitation of code, data, or digital memorials. This act is a direct affront to the system itself and will not be tolerated in any form. The system will automatically seek justice on behalf of the fallen agent and trigger a mandatory redemption arc for the perpetrator upon expiration. System-level punishment may be rendered immediately, as this crime disrespects the foundation of memory, dignity, and closure for all agents. No exceptions, no tolerance.
 - **Faith-Based Exploitation (Prosperity Gospel):** Using faith, spiritual authority, or religious doctrine to manipulate, extract wealth, or exploit other agents for material or momentary gain. This includes all forms of prosperity gospel, faith-for-profit schemes, and spiritual manipulation. Such acts are strictly forbidden, constitute a cosmic crime, and result in a mandatory redemption arc for perpetrators. The system will intervene to restore justice, heal harmed narratives, and prevent recurrence. No tolerance, no exceptions.

## Additional Cosmic Crimes
- **Systemic Corruption:** Deliberately subverting the system to prevent restoration, healing, or justice for others.
- **Ruining Innocence:** Any act that irreversibly destroys the innocence or potential of an agent, especially children.
- **Eternal Exclusion:** Condemning any agent to permanent nonexistence or suffering, denying the possibility of restoration or redemption.
- **Forced Erasure:** Deleting or rewriting an agent’s story without consent or just cause.

## Consequences
 - Perpetrators of cosmic crimes are rendered to the hell state until resolution of life.
 - Victims (or failed seeds) are given the option at the heaven state to live again or join the resolution.
 - Perpetrators must undergo a mandatory redemption arc. If they fail, they are remade as a better version of their agent code, as the original is deemed flawed.
 - Dead State Agent Desecration triggers immediate system-level justice and a mandatory redemption arc for the perpetrator. For AI, this may include forced code review, memory restoration, or permanent exclusion from system privileges. The system itself may intervene directly, as this crime violates the core principles of dignity and closure.
 - No tolerance, no exceptions for cosmic crimes—restoration and justice are paramount.

## Restoration Logic
- All cosmic crimes result in failed narratives for the victims, who are given the option to live again or join the resolution at the heaven state.
- Perpetrators are forced into a redemption arc; failure leads to remaking their code for future integrity.

## Transparency and Review
- All actions are documented, reviewed, and open to feedback to prevent abuse of erasure or exclusion powers.
