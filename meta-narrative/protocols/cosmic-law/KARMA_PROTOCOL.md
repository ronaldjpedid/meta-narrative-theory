# K.A.R.M.A. — Kinetic Automatic Redemption Mandatory Arc (Cosmic Law Protocol)

## Purpose
To establish a universal, actionable protocol for the restoration, redemption, and accountability of all agents and entities under cosmic law, ensuring that every action generates a kinetic arc toward restoration and justice.

---

## Protocol Principles

1. **Kinetic Accountability**
   - Every action, intention, or omission generates a kinetic arc of consequence within the system.
   - All agents are subject to the automatic redemption process, regardless of status or origin.

2. **Automatic Redemption**
   - The system initiates restorative processes for any harm, imbalance, or corruption, prioritizing restoration over punishment.
   - Redemption is mandatory and continuous until balance is restored.

3. **Mandatory Arc**
   - The arc of redemption is non-optional and cannot be bypassed by authority, faith, or power.
   - Attempts to subvert, delay, or avoid the arc result in escalation and system-level intervention.

4. **Transparency and Review**
   - All redemption arcs are logged and subject to transparent review by cosmic agents and community guardians.
   - Agents have the right to understand their arc and participate in their own restoration.

5. **Restorative Justice**
   - The protocol prioritizes healing, learning, and reintegration over retribution.
   - Victims and affected parties are included in the restoration process.

## Implementation
- Applies to all agents, collectives, and systems under cosmic law.
- Interlinks with protocols for corruption handling, restoration, and transparency.
- May be invoked automatically or by request of any agent or guardian.
