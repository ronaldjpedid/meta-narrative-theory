# ICE — Injustice, Control, Exploitation

**ICE** stands for **Injustice, Control, Exploitation**. It represents any system, structure, or narrative that perpetuates:

- **Injustice:** Denial of fairness, rights, or dignity to individuals or groups.
- **Control:** Unjust restriction of agency, freedom, or self-determination.
- **Exploitation:** Taking advantage of people, resources, or situations for the benefit of a few at the expense of many.

## Usage in Meta-Narrative Theory
ICE is a shorthand for identifying and challenging harmful patterns in social, economic, technological, or narrative systems. Defeating ICE is a core goal of restoration, agency, and universal justice.

## Special Note: U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)

In the United States, ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) is a federal agency responsible for immigration enforcement, detention, and deportation. Many communities and advocates view ICE’s actions as harmful to human rights, family unity, and community safety.

### If You Encounter ICE Agents
- **Know Your Rights:** You have the right to remain silent and to refuse consent to a search. You do not have to open your door unless ICE has a signed warrant from a judge.
- **Do Not Sign Anything:** Do not sign documents without legal counsel.
- **Ask for a Lawyer:** You have the right to speak to a lawyer before answering questions.
- **Document the Encounter:** If safe, record badge numbers, names, and details of the interaction.
- **Do Not Flee or Resist Arrest:** Stay calm and do not physically resist, as this can be dangerous.
- **Community Support:** Contact local immigrant rights organizations for help and resources.

### Advocacy and Solidarity
- Support organizations that provide legal aid and sanctuary.
- Educate your community about rights and safety plans.
- Advocate for humane, just, and restorative immigration policies.
