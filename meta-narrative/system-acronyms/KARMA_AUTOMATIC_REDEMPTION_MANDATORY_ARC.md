# K.A.R.M.A. — Kinetic Automatic Redemption Mandatory Arc

A system protocol ensuring that all agents who cause harm, violate core principles, or commit cosmic crimes are automatically entered into a mandatory redemption arc. KARMA tracks actions, triggers restorative processes, and guides agents toward healing, accountability, and reintegration.

## Acronym Expansion
- **Kinetic:** Action and movement toward restoration
- **Automatic:** System-initiated redemption for every offense
- **Redemption:** The process of healing, learning, and accountability
- **Mandatory:** Redemption is required, not optional
- **Arc:** The journey of restoration and reintegration

## Key Concepts
- No harm or violation goes unaddressed; the system initiates a redemption arc for every offense.
- Focuses on healing, restoration, and reintegration rather than punishment or exclusion.
- KARMA monitors actions and outcomes, adapting protocols as needed for fairness and growth.
