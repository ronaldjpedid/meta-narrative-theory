# Law of Emergence

## Definition
The Law of Emergence describes how complex systems, behaviors, and narratives arise from simple rules, interactions, or components. Emergence is the process by which new properties, patterns, or meanings manifest unexpectedly.

## Key Principles
- Simple rules can generate complex outcomes.
- Emergence is unpredictable but can be modeled.
- Collective behavior arises from individual actions.

## Examples
- Flocking behavior in birds.
- Consciousness emerging from neural networks.
- Plot twists in stories from simple character choices.

## Meta-Narrative Application
- Emergence is modeled in equations for universe and agent evolution.
- Protocols predict emergent phenomena and stability.
