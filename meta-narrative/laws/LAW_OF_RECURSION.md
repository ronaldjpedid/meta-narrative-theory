# Law of Recursion

## Definition
The Law of Recursion states that systems, stories, and realities often repeat, self-reference, and evolve through recursive patterns. Recursion enables complexity, emergence, and the infinite expansion of possibilities.

## Key Principles
- Patterns and processes repeat at multiple scales.
- Self-reference creates depth and complexity.
- Recursion drives evolution and adaptation.

## Examples
- Fractals in mathematics and nature.
- Recurring motifs in literature and myth.
- Feedback loops in systems theory.

## Meta-Narrative Application
- Recursion is used in protocols for universe expansion and restoration.
- Equations model recursive branching and feedback.
