# Law of Observer Principle

## Definition
The Law of Observer Principle states that reality, narrative, and system outcomes are shaped by observation, participation, and perspective. The act of observing or engaging with a system influences its state and evolution.

## Key Principles
- Observation changes the state of a system.
- Perspective and participation create new possibilities.
- The observer is an active agent in reality and narrative.

## Examples
- Quantum mechanics: observation affects particle state.
- Audience participation in interactive stories.
- Feedback from users shaping system evolution.

## Meta-Narrative Application
- Observer principle is modeled in branching and feedback protocols.
- Equations predict observer-driven change and emergence.
