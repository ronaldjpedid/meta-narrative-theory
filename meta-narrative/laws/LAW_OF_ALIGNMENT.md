# Law of Alignment

## Definition
The Law of Alignment states that systems, agents, and narratives seek coherence, harmony, and alignment with their core principles, values, or goals. Alignment is necessary for stability, restoration, and meaningful outcomes.

## Key Principles
- Systems tend toward coherence and harmony.
- Misalignment leads to instability, conflict, or entropy.
- Restoration protocols aim to realign agents and systems.

## Examples

- Narrative alignment in story arcs.

## Meta-Narrative Application
- Alignment is modeled in restoration and stability equations.
- Protocols guide agents toward alignment and coherence.
