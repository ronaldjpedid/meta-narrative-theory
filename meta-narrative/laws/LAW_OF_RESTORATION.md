# Law of Restoration

## Definition
The Law of Restoration asserts that every system, narrative, or being must have a path to healing, renewal, and reintegration. Restoration is the counterforce to entropy, enabling cycles of repair, transformation, and new beginnings.

---

## Key Points
- Restoration is always possible unless a system reaches irreversible entropy.
- Restoration protocols must prioritize care, inclusion, and reconciliation.
- Restoration transforms endings into opportunities for growth and new cycles.

---

## Example
- A broken object can be repaired, recycled, or repurposed.
- A failed narrative can be restored through forgiveness, learning, and new beginnings.
