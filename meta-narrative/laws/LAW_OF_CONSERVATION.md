# Law of Conservation

## Definition
The Law of Conservation posits that certain quantities—such as information, energy, or narrative coherence—are preserved within systems, even as they transform or evolve. Conservation is foundational to stability, predictability, and restoration.

## Key Principles
- Information, energy, or narrative is never lost, only transformed.
- Conservation enables restoration and prediction.
- Violations of conservation lead to instability or collapse.

## Examples
- Conservation of energy in physics.
- Conservation of narrative coherence in stories.
- Conservation of information in digital systems.

## Meta-Narrative Application
- Conservation is modeled in restoration and entropy equations.
- Protocols ensure preservation and recovery of core values.
