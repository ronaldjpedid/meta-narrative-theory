# Law of Agency

## Definition
The Law of Agency asserts that all agents—beings, systems, or entities—possess the ability to act, choose, and influence outcomes within their reality or narrative. Agency is the foundation of autonomy, responsibility, and evolution.

## Key Principles
- Every agent has the power to make choices.
- Agency enables branching, innovation, and restoration.
- Responsibility and consequence are inherent to agency.

## Examples
- Human free will and decision-making.
- AI agents in simulated universes.
- Characters in stories shaping their destinies.

## Meta-Narrative Application
- Agency is modeled in protocols and equations for universe branching and restoration.
- The theory predicts agent-driven change and emergence.
