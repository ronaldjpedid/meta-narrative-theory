# Law of Three

## Definition
The Law of Three states that every duality must allow for synthesis, renewal, and new beginnings. In any system, narrative, or relationship, two opposing forces (duality) are always resolved or transcended by a third element—creating balance, transformation, and generativity.

---

## Key Points
- Duality (e.g., light/dark, order/chaos) is never final; synthesis is always possible.
- The third element enables renewal, healing, and the creation of new cycles.
- The Law of Three is foundational for narrative branching, system stability, and restoration protocols.

---

## Example
- In narrative: Protagonist vs. antagonist is resolved by a new perspective, alliance, or transformation.
- In physics: Matter and antimatter are balanced by energy or new particle creation.
