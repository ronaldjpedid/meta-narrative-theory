# Law of Entropy

## Definition
The Law of Entropy states that all systems naturally tend toward disorder, decay, and dissolution. Entropy is an unavoidable force in physical, biological, and narrative systems, driving cycles of breakdown and transformation.

---

## Key Points
- Entropy is inevitable; all things decay and end.
- Entropy creates the need for restoration, renewal, and new cycles.
- Systems must be designed to detect decay and enable healing or transformation.

---

## Example
- A car breaks down over time and eventually cannot be repaired.
- A story reaches its conclusion and must be renewed or replaced.
