# Meta-Narrative Laws Index & Guide

This folder contains all foundational laws governing the meta-narrative system. Each law is documented with its definition, key principles, examples, meta-narrative application, and references. These laws provide the logical, philosophical, and scientific basis for protocols, equations, and story models.

## Purpose
- To provide a clear index and guide for all meta-narrative laws.
- To help users, reviewers, and contributors quickly locate and understand each law and its context.
- To support onboarding, documentation, and theory refinement.
