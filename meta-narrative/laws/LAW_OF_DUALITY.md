# Law of Duality

## Definition
The Law of Duality states that all systems, narratives, and realities are governed by the interplay of opposites—light and dark, order and chaos, love and fear, creation and destruction. Duality is foundational to balance, transformation, and the emergence of meaning.

## Key Principles
- Every force or concept has an opposite or complement.
- Balance between dualities is necessary for stability and growth.
- Duality enables choice, agency, and narrative branching.

## Examples
- Yin and Yang in Eastern philosophy.
- Good vs. Evil in stories and mythologies.
- Matter and antimatter in physics.

## Meta-Narrative Application
- Duality drives conflict, resolution, and transformation in stories.
- Protocols and equations often model dual forces to predict outcomes.
