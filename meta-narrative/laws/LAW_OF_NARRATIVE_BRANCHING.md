# Law of Narrative Branching

## Definition
The Law of Narrative Branching asserts that every choice, action, or event creates new possible realities, storylines, or outcomes. Branching is the mechanism by which universes, stories, and agents evolve and diversify.

## Key Principles
- Every decision creates a new branch or possibility.
- Branching leads to parallel universes, alternate endings, and diverse outcomes.
- The branching process can be modeled and predicted.

## Examples
- Choose-your-own-adventure books.
- Quantum branching in many-worlds interpretation.
- Decision trees in AI and game design.

## Meta-Narrative Application
- Branching is central to universe creation and agent evolution.
- Equations model branching probability and coherence.
