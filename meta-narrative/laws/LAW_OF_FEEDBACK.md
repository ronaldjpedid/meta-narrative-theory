# Law of Feedback

## Definition
The Law of Feedback states that all actions, choices, and events produce feedback loops that influence future states, behaviors, and outcomes. Feedback is essential for learning, adaptation, and system stability.

## Key Principles
- Feedback loops drive adaptation and change.
- Positive feedback amplifies effects; negative feedback stabilizes systems.
- Feedback can be immediate or delayed.

## Examples
- Thermostat regulation in engineering.
- Social feedback in communities.
- Plot feedback in stories (actions have consequences).

## Meta-Narrative Application
- Feedback is modeled in restoration and stability protocols.
- Equations predict feedback effects and system evolution.
