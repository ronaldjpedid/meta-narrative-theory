# Base Reality Seed: Visual Models

## 1. Seed Propagation Diagram

```
        S₀
         |
   --------------
   |     |     |
  N₁    N₂    N₃
  |      |      |
 ...   ...    ...
```
- S₀: The unique, unanchored seed event.
- N₁, N₂, N₃: First-level narrative branches (main, side, observer, etc.).
- Each branch recursively splits, representing propagation of agency, complexity, and narrative structure.

## 2. Anchor/Counterweight Chain (Symmetry)

```
S₀ — A₁ — C₁ — A₂ — C₂ — ...
```
- S₀: Seed.
- A₁, A₂: Anchors (stabilizing agents or roles).
- C₁, C₂: Counterweights (balancing forces).
- The chain can be visualized as a spiral or loop for recursive stability.

## 3. Narrative Tree Structure

```
        S₀
         |
   --------------
   |     |     |
Main  Side1  Side2
  |           |
 ...        Observer
```
- S₀: Root of the narrative tree.
- Main: Main storyline.
- Side1, Side2: Side narratives.
- Observer: Observer/participant branch.

## 4. Quantum Immortality Flow

```
Timeline:
S₀ → ... → X (collapse)
           ↘
            → (alternate branch continues)
```
- X: Narrative collapse or death event.
- Alternate branch: Narrative persists elsewhere, illustrating quantum immortality.
