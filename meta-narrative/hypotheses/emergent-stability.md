# Emergent Stability Equation

## Equation
$$
S = f\left(\sum_{i=1}^N \text{Agency}_i, \text{Ethics}, \text{Collaboration}\right)
$$

## Conceptual Explanation
Narrative stability ($S$) emerges from the total agency, ethical alignment, and collaboration among participants. The function $f$ models how these factors interact.

- **Ethics:** Shared values and boundaries.
- **Collaboration:** The degree of cooperative action.

## Practical Example
A story with high agency, strong ethics, and good collaboration is stable and self-sustaining. Remove one, and instability or collapse may result.

## Implications
- Stability is not guaranteed; it must be cultivated.
- Ethical and collaborative breakdowns threaten narrative survival.
