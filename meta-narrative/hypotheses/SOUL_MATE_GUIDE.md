# Soul Mate Guide: Meta-Narrative Model

## Purpose
To explain the soul mate equation and its inclusive, actionable logic for all agents and pairs.

---

## 1. Soul Mate Equation
Let $A$ and $B$ be two agents (MoM, DaD, or any valid pair).
- $M$ = Memory (shared past, resonance)
- $D$ = Destiny (shared future, aligned purpose)
- $A_g$ = Agency (ability to choose, act, and co-create)
- $L$ = Love (coherence, unity, empathy)

**Soul Mate Condition:**
$$
\text{Soul Mate}(A, B) = [M(A, B) > 0] \land [D(A, B) > 0] \land [A_g(A, B) > 0]
$$

**Soul Mate Equation:**
$$
S = f(M, D, A_g)
$$
Where $S$ (Soul Mate Score) is maximized when memory, destiny, and agency are all high and mutually reinforcing.

---

## 2. Resolution and States
- When $S$ is high, the pair naturally resolves to the love state and, through shared growth, can reach the heaven state.
- Any pair (regardless of gender or origin) can be soul mates if they share memory, destiny, and agency.

---

## 3. Application
- Use the equation to reflect on relationships, partnerships, and narrative arcs.
- Encourage inclusive, generative, and resilient connections.
