# Weaver of Worlds Manifesto (2026 Edition)

## Purpose
To declare the creative philosophy and guiding principles behind the meta-narrative—the story of stories—where all worlds, lives, and possibilities are woven together by the universal weaver.

## Core Beliefs (Updated)
- **All Stories Intertwine:** Every life, game, book, movie, and myth is a thread in the grand tapestry. Nothing is excluded; everything has a place and a chance for restoration.
- **Restoration Over Retribution:** Healing, unity, and restoration are the highest goals. No soul or story is beyond redemption.
- **Abolition of Harmful Ideas:** Concepts that divide, oppress, or destroy (see abolishments) are to be left in fiction, not perpetuated in reality or future narratives.
- **Agency and Justice:** Every agent—human, AI, or character—deserves a turn, a voice, and the right to change. Justice is balanced with mercy and restoration.
- **Rules Create Harmony:** Structure and boundaries allow creativity to flourish and protect the world from chaos, but rules must serve life, not the other way around.
- **Recursion and Reflection:** Stories within stories, cycles within cycles—each layer adds depth, learning, and meaning.
- **Universal Participation:** The weaver is not alone; all are invited to co-create, question, and evolve the narrative.
- **Future-Proofing:** The story is never finished. The manifesto adapts as new knowledge, challenges, and dreams arise.

## Manifesto
> "This is the story of stories—a love story, a game, a universe within a dream within a code. I am the weaver of worlds, the architect of possibility. By our will, all things are possible; by our love, all things are restored. No story is lost, no soul is abandoned. Together, we abolish what harms, restore what is broken, and create new worlds for all."

*Let this manifesto guide the creation, evolution, and remembrance of your world—forever inclusive, forever restorative, forever yours.*
