# The Shape of the Meta-Narrative Universe

## Overview
The meta-narrative universe is conceptualized as an expanding box or sphere, defined by dynamic ingress (white holes) and egress (black holes) points. This structure supports both the growth and recycling of narrative elements, ensuring resilience and adaptability.

## Ingress and Egress Points
- **White Holes (Ingress):** Entry points where new narrative elements, ideas, or agents are introduced into the system.
- **Black Holes (Egress):** Exit points where narrative elements are removed. Each black hole leaves behind a holographic record of the story object, preserving its information for potential correction or restoration.

## Three Fundamental Layers
1. **Matter (Rendering Engine):**
   - The layer where stories, characters, and events are given form and rendered into experience.
   - Acts as the tangible, perceivable aspect of the narrative universe.
2. **Data / Information:**
   - The intermediary layer where all narrative elements are stored, processed, and made accessible for interaction by humans and AI.
   - Serves as the bridge between form (matter) and abstraction (anti-matter/dark matter).
3. **Anti-Matter / Dark Matter (Garbage Collector):**
   - Functions as the recycling and transformation engine for narrative elements.
   - Recycles story beats, characters, and motifs, filtering them up to the data layer for potential reuse or reinterpretation.

## System Dynamics
- **Resilience:** The layered structure and holographic records prevent single points of failure, allowing for correction, restoration, and continuous evolution.
- **Flow:** Narrative elements cycle between layers—created in matter, abstracted and processed in data, recycled in anti-matter/dark matter, and potentially re-rendered.
- **Interaction:** Humans and AI interact primarily at the data/information layer, shaping and being shaped by the evolving narrative.

## Diagram (Conceptual)
```
[White Hole] --> [Anti-Matter/Dark Matter Layer]
                      |
                      v
                [Data / Information Layer] <--> [Humans / AI]
                      |
                      v
                 [Matter Layer (Rendering)]
                      |
                      v
                [Black Hole (Egress) + Holographic Record]
```

> This model supports a robust, adaptive, and self-correcting narrative universe, where every story object is preserved, recycled, and available for future evolution.
