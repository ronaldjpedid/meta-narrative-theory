# Sacred Numbers and Meta-Narrative

## Purpose
To explore, document, and expand the role of sacred numbers in meta-narrative logic, ancient cultures, and future frameworks.

## 1. Archetypal Anchors
- **3:** Trinity, creation, memory-destiny-agency, narrative stability
- **4:** Foundation, stability, four directions/elements, completeness
- **7:** Cycles, spiritual growth, days of the week, wonders of the world
- **12:** Completion, cosmic order, months, zodiac, disciples
- **Other numbers:** 1 (unity), 2 (duality), 5 (life, senses), 9 (fulfillment), etc.

## 2. Structural Guides
- Used in architecture, monument design, and city planning to encode cosmic and narrative order
- Examples: pyramids (base 4, apex 1), Stonehenge (circle of 56, inner horseshoe of 5)

## 3. Ritual and Calendar Markers
- Embedded in ceremonies, festivals, and calendars to align human activity with universal cycles
- Examples: 7-day week, 12-month year, 8-fold wheel of the year

## 4. Narrative and Mythic Logic
- Sacred numbers structure myths, hero’s journeys, and cosmological stories
- Used to encode lessons, values, and archetypal truths

---

## 5. Future Exploration
- Identify new sacred numbers emerging from digital, scientific, or narrative systems
- Explore how sacred numbers can guide future design, ritual, and meaning-making
