# The Master Equation of Meta-Narrative

## Master Equation

$$
MN = f(M, C, S, R, D, A_g, B, L, O, ...)
$$

Where:
- $MN$ = Meta-Narrative system state or health
- $M$ = Meaning (coherence, purpose)
- $C$ = Connection (relationships, bonds)
- $S$ = Stability (resilience, balance)
- $R$ = Risk (threats to integrity)
- $D$ = Discovery (awareness of loops, anomalies)
- $A_g$ = Agency (ability to act)
- $B$ = Boundaries (limits, constraints)
- $L$ = Leadership (guidance, restoration)
- $O$ = Observers/Overseers (law of three: memory, destiny, agency; $O \geq 3$ for stable universe)
- $UV$ = Universal Values (what drives us)
- $...$ = Additional variables as needed (e.g., narrative drift, feedback, anchors, weights)

The function $f$ combines these variables to model the overall state, evolution, and recovery of the meta-narrative. When $MN$ is high, the system is healthy, meaningful, and resilient. When $MN$ drops, intervention by admins, guardians, or participants may be needed.
