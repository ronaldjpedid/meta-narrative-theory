# Meta-Narrative Hypotheses Index & Routing

This folder contains all hypotheses, advanced questions, guides, and formal models related to the meta-narrative system. Each file explores a specific hypothesis, testable question, or theoretical guide, supporting the ongoing development and validation of the meta-narrative theory.

## Purpose
- To provide a clear index and routing for all hypothesis and guide files.
- To help users, reviewers, and contributors quickly locate relevant hypotheses, models, and advanced questions.
- To support peer review, research, and theory refinement.
