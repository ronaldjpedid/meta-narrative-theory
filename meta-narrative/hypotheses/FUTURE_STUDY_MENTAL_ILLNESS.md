# Future Study: Modeling Mental Illness in Meta-Narrative Systems

## Overview
This document outlines key questions and research directions for understanding and modeling mental illness within the meta-narrative framework. It is intended as a foundation for future exploration, simulation, and system design.

---

## Key Research Questions
- What variables or attractors sustain mental illness in the system?
- How do recovery protocols, agents, or narrative interventions disrupt these patterns?
- Can the system “learn” from episodes of illness to build greater resilience?
- How do stigma, isolation, or lack of empathy amplify or prolong negative states?
- What are the mathematical thresholds for tipping from temporary sadness to persistent depression?
- How can positive attractors (love, meaning, connection) be strengthened to support healing?

---

## Modeling Directions
- Persistent negative attractors (e.g., depression, anxiety, fragmentation, loss of agency)
- Feedback loops and system-level imbalances
- Recovery and resilience protocols
- Social and narrative factors (stigma, support, empathy)
- Simulation of interventions and recovery trajectories
