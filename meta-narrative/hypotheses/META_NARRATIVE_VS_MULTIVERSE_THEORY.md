# Meta-Narrative Cosmology vs. Multiverse Theory

## Purpose
To compare and contrast meta-narrative cosmology with multiverse theory, highlighting scope, strengths, and complementary aspects.

---

## 1. Foundations
- **Multiverse Theory:** Models reality as a collection of many universes, each with its own laws and initial conditions; focuses on branching, parallel worlds.
- **Meta-Narrative Cosmology:** Models reality as generative, relational, and story-based; focuses on agency, meaning, and universe formation through narrative logic.

---

## 2. Scope
- **Multiverse Theory:** Explains the existence of many universes and branching possibilities.
- **Meta-Narrative Cosmology:** Explains emergence, purpose, and closure of universes, agents, and stories.

---

## 3. Complementarity
- Multiverse theory describes the substrate; meta-narrative explains the patterns, relationships, and meaning that arise from it.
- Both frameworks can coexist, each addressing different layers of reality.

---

## 4. Strengths of Meta-Narrative Cosmology
- Addresses questions of purpose, agency, and renewal.
- Models universe formation, growth, and closure as narrative arcs.
- Integrates ethical, relational, and generative logic.
