# Future Study: Meta-Narrative Approaches to Cancer and Childhood Tragedy

## Overview
This document proposes research directions for applying meta-narrative principles to address cancer and tragic outcomes in children’s stories. The goal is to reduce narrative decoherence, promote healing, and inspire new protocols for prevention, intervention, and recovery.

---

## Key Research Questions
- How does the recurrence of cancer and childhood tragedy in stories contribute to system decoherence and collective trauma?
- What narrative attractors, feedback loops, or system imbalances sustain these patterns?
- How can meta-narrative protocols (e.g., recovery, love, agency, coherence) be used to rewrite or prevent these outcomes?
- What new story structures, interventions, or support systems can be designed to protect children from entering the Dead State through illness or violence?
- How can the system amplify positive attractors (healing, resilience, protection, hope) for vulnerable agents?
- What role do external influences (media, culture, policy) play in perpetuating or resolving these themes?

## Modeling Directions
- Identify and disrupt negative attractors and feedback loops that lead to tragic outcomes for children.
- Simulate alternative storylines and interventions that prioritize healing, prevention, and protection.
- Develop new protocols for narrative recovery, agent empowerment, and system-wide resilience.
- Collaborate with experts in medicine, psychology, education, and storytelling to co-create solutions.
