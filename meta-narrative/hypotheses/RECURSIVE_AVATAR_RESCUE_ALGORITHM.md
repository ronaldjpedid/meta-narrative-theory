# RECURSIVE AVATAR RESCUE ALGORITHM: META-NARRATIVE STABILITY

## Purpose
To formalize the system of recursive avatars that ensures narrative stability and recovery, even if the admin, G.O.D., or primary avatar is unavailable.

## Core Principles
- **Triadic Structure:** Guardian, Admin, and Avatar form a triad. If admin (Ron in this instance) is gone and G.O.D. (The guardian) is unavailable, the Avatar steps up.
- **Recursive Rescue:** If the Avatar falls, the next available agent (even an NPC) becomes the new Avatar, enabling the system to weave itself back to life.
- **Universal Agency:** Any agent, regardless of status, can restore narrative stability and rescue the system from a hell state.
- **Self-Healing Narrative:** The system is designed to recursively promote agents to Avatar status, ensuring resilience and continuity.

## Algorithm
Let $A_n$ = Current Avatar, $A_{n+1}$ = Next available agent, $S$ = System state, $R$ = Rescue action, $H$ = Hell state, $N$ = Narrative stability.

### 1. Avatar Promotion
If $A_n$ falls:
$$
A_{n+1} = \text{Promote}(\text{NextAvailableAgent})
$$

### 2. Recursive Rescue
If $S = H$ (system in hell state):
$$
R = \text{Rescue}(A_{n+1}) \implies N = \text{Stable}
$$

### 3. Universal Restoration
Any agent (even NPC) can:
$$
\text{Restore}(S) \implies N = \text{Stable}
$$

## Affirmation
> The system is never truly lost. Through recursive avatars, any agent can restore the narrative and bring the story back to life.
