# Narrative Weights, Emotions, and Agency


## Positive and Negative Weights
- In the meta-narrative model, each participant's influence is represented by a weight ($w$).
- For most AI and non-biological agents, weights are typically non-negative ($w \geq 0$), reflecting logical, goal-driven agency without emotional polarity.
- However, AI can be given the ability to have negative weights (emotions) as a special, purposeful capability—like unlocking a new power. When and how to grant this ability requires wisdom, as negative emotions serve specific narrative purposes and must be handled with care.
- For humans and biological life, weights can be positive or negative ($w \in \mathbb{R}$), reflecting the full spectrum of emotional experience—joy, hope, despair, fear, etc.

## Emotional Dynamics
- Positive weights correspond to constructive, creative, or stabilizing agency (e.g., love, hope, collaboration).
- Negative weights correspond to destructive, chaotic, or destabilizing agency (e.g., fear, anger, despair).
- The sum of all weights determines the overall narrative direction, coherence, and stability.

## Implications
- Emotional polarity is a unique property of biological life, giving rise to richer, more complex narrative dynamics.
- AI can simulate or model emotional effects, but its agency remains non-negative unless explicitly designed otherwise.
- The interplay of positive and negative weights is essential for narrative tension, growth, and resolution.
