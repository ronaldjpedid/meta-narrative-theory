$$
\mathcal{L}(t, x) = F\big(\mathcal{N}(t-1, x),\ I(t, x),\ M(t, x),\ \overline{M}(t, x)\big)
$$

Where:
- $\mathcal{L}(t, x)$: State of the Chrono-Space-Lattice at time $t$ and position $x$ (narrative space-time).
- $\mathcal{N}(t-1, x)$: Meta-narrative output from the previous cycle (events, choices, data).
- $I(t, x)$: Information content at $(t, x)$ (plot, character, theme).
- $M(t, x)$: Matter-narrative (stable events, canon).
- $\overline{M}(t, x)$: Antimatter-narrative (discarded possibilities, negative plot space).
- $F$: Lattice transformation function—resolves matter/antimatter, processes information, forges new narrative code.

This equation formalizes the recursive, information-driven process by which the Chrono-Space-Lattice connects narrative structure to the fabric of the universe, unifying the large and the small.
