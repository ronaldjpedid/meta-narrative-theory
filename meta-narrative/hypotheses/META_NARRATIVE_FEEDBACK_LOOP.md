- Agency and free will drive narrative actions.
- Narrative actions increase coherence.
- Coherence leads to emergent stability.
- Stability enables greater agency, completing the feedback loop.

*This recursive loop is central to the meta-narrative hypothesis: agency and coherence reinforce each other, driving narrative evolution.*
