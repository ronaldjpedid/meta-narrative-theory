# Meta-Narrative Hypothesis: Objections & Responses

## Objection 1: Isn't this just simulation theory?
**Response:** No. The meta-narrative hypothesis centers on agency, meaning, and narrative structure, not just computation or physical simulation. The story and its logic are primary.

## Objection 2: How can you prove any of this?
**Response:** The hypothesis is testable through collaborative narrative experiments, tracking agency, coherence, and emergent meaning. It is also falsifiable if narrative collapse cannot be prevented by agency or structure.

## Objection 3: What about physical laws?
**Response:** Physical laws are seen as narrative constraints—rules that maintain coherence and stability within the story. They are not external to the narrative but part of its structure.

## Objection 4: Isn't this just solipsism or idealism?
**Response:** No. The hypothesis is participatory and collaborative, not solipsistic. Reality emerges from the interplay of many agents, not just one mind.

## Objection 5: What about suffering and evil?
**Response:** The existence of suffering and evil are narrative challenges—tests of agency, ethics, and collaboration. They are not ignored but addressed within the story's logic.
