# Trust and Betrayal Model

## Purpose
Quantifies trust between agents and models how actions affect trust over time.

## Equation
Let $T_{ij}$ be the trust coefficient from agent $i$ to agent $j$:

$$
T_{ij}^{(t+1)} = T_{ij}^{(t)} + \Delta T_{ij}
$$

- $\Delta T_{ij}$ is the change in trust due to actions (positive for trust-building, negative for betrayal).

## Usage
- Track trust dynamics, simulate alliances, and model consequences of betrayal.

---
*This model formalizes trust and betrayal in narrative systems.*
