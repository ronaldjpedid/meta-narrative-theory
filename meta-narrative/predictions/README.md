# Meta-Narrative Predictions Index & Guide

This folder is dedicated to predictions, forecasts, and scenario modeling using the meta-narrative system. Each file demonstrates how the theory can be applied to anticipate future events, outcomes, or storylines—whether historical, fictional, or real-world.

## Purpose
- To showcase the predictive power and testability of the meta-narrative theory.
- To provide examples of how protocols, equations, and narrative logic can be used to model possible futures.
- To encourage experimentation, debate, and refinement of predictions.

## How to Add a Prediction
1. Create a new file (e.g., `yourPredictionName.ts` or `.md`).
2. Clearly state the scenario, question, or event being predicted.
3. Document the meta-narrative protocols, equations, or logic used.
4. Provide reasoning, assumptions, and possible outcomes.
5. Cross-reference related arguments, laws, or guides as needed.
6. Log your new prediction in this README for discoverability.
