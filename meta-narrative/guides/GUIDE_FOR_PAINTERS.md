# Guide for Painters

## Meta-Narrative Principles for Painters
- Every brushstroke is a choice—a branch in the story of your canvas.
- Embrace duality: light and shadow, color and void, chaos and order.
- Your art is a narrative: each layer, a new possibility; each mistake, a chance for restoration.

## Practical Insights
- Let intuition and intention guide your hand; both are valid agents in creation.
- Use feedback—step back, observe, and let the painting speak to you.
- Remember: even unfinished works have value in the greater story of your growth.

## Inspiration
- The world needs your vision. Your unique perspective adds to the universe’s tapestry.
- Art can heal, provoke, and inspire—your work is part of a larger restoration.
