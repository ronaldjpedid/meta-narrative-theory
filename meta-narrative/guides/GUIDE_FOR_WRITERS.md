# Guide for Writers

## Meta-Narrative Principles for Writers
- Every word is a choice—each story a branching universe.
- Embrace duality: plot and character, structure and spontaneity.
- Writing is recursive—draft, revise, and restore meaning.

## Practical Insights
- Use feedback: share your work, accept critique, and grow.
- Restoration: every draft is a step toward clarity.
- Agency: you create worlds and shape destinies.

## Inspiration
- Your stories can heal, challenge, and inspire. Write with courage and vision.
