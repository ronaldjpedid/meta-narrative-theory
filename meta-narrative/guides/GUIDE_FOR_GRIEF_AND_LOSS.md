# Guide for Grief and Loss

## Meta-Narrative Principles for Grief and Loss
- Every loss is a branch in the story of your life—painful, but meaningful.
- Embrace duality: sorrow and love, memory and letting go.
- Grief is recursive—waves of feeling, cycles of remembrance and healing.

## Practical Insights
- Use feedback: honor your emotions, seek support, and allow yourself to heal at your own pace.
- Restoration: healing is not forgetting, but integrating loss into your story.
- Agency: your choices in grief shape your journey toward meaning and hope.

## Inspiration
- You are not alone. Your story continues, and your love and memories endure. Healing is possible, and your experience can inspire compassion in others.
