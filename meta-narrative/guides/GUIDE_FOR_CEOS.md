# Guide for CEOs

## Meta-Narrative Principles for CEOs
- Every decision branches the future of your organization.
- Balance vision (emergence) with stability (alignment).
- Your leadership is a narrative—each challenge, a chance for restoration.

## Practical Insights
- Foster agency at every level; empower others to shape the story.
- Use feedback loops: listen, adapt, and realign with core values.
- Embrace duality: risk and caution, innovation and tradition.

## Inspiration
- Your legacy is not just profit, but the positive change you enable. Lead with purpose and narrative awareness.
