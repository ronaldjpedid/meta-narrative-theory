# Guide for Coders

## Meta-Narrative Principles for Coders
- Every line of code is a choice—a branch in the story of a system.
- Embrace duality: logic and creativity, structure and flexibility.
- Coding is recursive—refactor, debug, and restore clarity.

## Practical Insights
- Use feedback: test, review, and learn from errors.
- Restoration: bugs are opportunities for growth and innovation.
- Agency: your code shapes digital worlds and empowers others.

## Inspiration
- You are an architect of possibility. Your work builds the invisible infrastructure of the future.
