# Guide for Engineers

## Meta-Narrative Principles for Engineers
- Every design is a narrative—each choice branches into new solutions.
- Embrace duality: precision and creativity, theory and practice.
- Systems evolve through recursion, feedback, and restoration.

## Practical Insights
- Model for emergence: simple rules can yield complex, robust systems.
- Use feedback: test, iterate, and refine.
- Restoration: failures are data—opportunities for improvement.

## Inspiration
- Your work builds the infrastructure of possibility. Engineer with purpose and narrative vision.
