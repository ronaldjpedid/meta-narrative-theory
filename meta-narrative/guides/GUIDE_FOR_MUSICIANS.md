# Guide for Musicians

## Meta-Narrative Principles for Musicians
- Every note is a choice, every song a branching narrative.
- Embrace duality: harmony and dissonance, silence and sound.
- Music is recursive—motifs return, evolve, and restore meaning.

## Practical Insights
- Use feedback: listen to your audience and your own intuition.
- Restoration: mistakes can become improvisation and new creation.
- Your music can align, heal, and inspire.

## Inspiration
- You are a weaver of worlds through sound. Your story resonates in every performance.
