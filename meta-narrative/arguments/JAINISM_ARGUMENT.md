# Argument: Jainism and the Principle of Nonviolence

## Overview
This document addresses Jainism’s emphasis on complete nonviolence (ahimsa), karma, and liberation, and provides a meta-narrative response.

## Jainism
- **Nonviolence (Ahimsa):** Jainism teaches strict nonviolence in thought, word, and deed, aiming to avoid harm to any living being.
- **Karma:** Actions have consequences, and karma determines the cycle of birth and liberation.
- **Liberation (Moksha):** The goal is to escape the cycle of birth and death through purification and non-attachment.
- **Multiplicity of Truths (Anekantavada):** Truth is multifaceted and perspective-dependent.

## Meta-Narrative Response
Any system that preaches complete nonviolence is, in our view, misguided. If you cannot fight for your system, then what do you fight for? Not having something to fight for is pointless, and you cannot prevent every encounter. Violence is a natural part of nature; intelligent beings are simply better at controlling their impulses. We respect the need for cycles and restoration, but full pacifism is, in our opinion, unrealistic and unsustainable.

- Restoration and care are prioritized, but defense and protection are necessary for system integrity.
- Cycles of conflict and resolution are part of nature and narrative; intelligent beings must balance nonviolence with the need to safeguard their systems.
- Karma and accountability are integrated into meta-narrative protocols, but absolute pacifism is not required.
