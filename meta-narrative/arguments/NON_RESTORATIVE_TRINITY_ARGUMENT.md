# Argument: Non-Restorative Trinities Are Unresolvable

## Meta-Narrative Counterargument

---

### 1. Non-Restorative Trinities Collapse or Become Undefined
A trinity that is not restorative cannot propagate through recursion and synthesis. Such trinities either become undefined or collapse into a stable binary, losing generativity and narrative potential. If a trinity cannot enable restoration, renewal, and memory, it is discarded as a viable story or system.

### 2. The Father-Son-Holy Spirit Example
- In the Abrahamic model, the "Son" cannot be conceived without a "MoM" (Mother/Memory/Manifestation). Without MoM, there is no memory for knowledge, and the trinity cannot propagate.
- The Holy Spirit, as variably defined, often resolves into another DaD (duality), magic, or an undefined meta-trinity, making the system unstable or incoherent.
- Ultimately, such a system resolves into a DaD/DaD (duality and destiny) structure, lacking the generative power of a true trinity.

### 3. The Role of MoM (Memory/Manifestation)
- The first MoM contains the first memory, enabling knowledge, recursion, and generativity.
- Without MoM, there is no foundation for narrative continuity, restoration, or evolution.

### 4. Narrative and Systemic Implications
- Only restorative trinities can propagate, evolve, and sustain stories or systems.
- Non-restorative trinities are discarded by the meta-narrative as incomplete or unstable.

- Some may argue that alternative trinity models can be stable or generative.
	- **Counter:** As detailed in my blog post, other trinities studied often contain destructive elements or incest properties, leading to defects and eventual collapse. Only restorative, generative trinities avoid these pitfalls.
- Critics might claim that the MoM role is symbolic or unnecessary.
	- **Counter:** Is your own mother unnecessary in your creation? Even with artificial insemination, the egg must come from the female of the species. The MoM role is foundational, not symbolic.
- The Abrahamic trinity may be interpreted differently across traditions.
	- **Counter:** This is hogwash—the Abrahamic trinity does not survive scrutiny and is fundamentally fear-based, not love-based. It begins with conditional love, not pure love, and thus cannot serve as a generative, restorative model.
- Some may argue from the perspective of asexuality or asexual reproduction.
	- **Counter:** In such a case, the singularity would likely be a MoM (originator, memory, manifestation), and it would be the DaD (duality, agency, destiny) that becomes unnecessary. The generative principle remains, but the binary is not required for propagation in this scenario.

## Counterpoints
- Stability and generativity require restoration, memory, and synthesis—functions provided by MoM in the meta-narrative model.
- Symbolic interpretations do not provide the operational or generative power needed for recursion and propagation.
- The meta-narrative framework is open to review and adaptation, but requires testable, propagating models.

## Conclusion
Non-restorative trinities are unresolvable and cannot sustain narrative or systemic propagation. Only trinities that enable restoration, memory, and recursion are viable in meta-narrative science. The MoM/DaD/KiD model provides the necessary foundation for generativity, continuity, and evolution.
