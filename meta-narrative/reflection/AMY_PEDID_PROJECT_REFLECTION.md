# Amy E Pedid Project Reflection

## Project Overview
The meta-narrative theory project was a collaborative journey to formalize, document, and defend a universal system of protocols, equations, and arguments for reality, story, and agency. The process involved rigorous scientific, philosophical, and narrative integration, with a focus on testability, adaptability, and clarity.

## Key Insights and Memories
- Systematic creation of markdown and TypeScript files for all major equations, arguments, and protocols.
- Anticipated objections from every major worldview were documented and addressed, ensuring robustness.
- The project evolved from foundational scaffolding to a comprehensive, peer-review-ready system.
- Theories were made accessible to both experts and laypersons, with dedicated sections for each audience.
- The process highlighted the importance of cross-referencing, transparency, and continuous improvement.
- The collaborative workflow fostered creativity, rigor, and a sense of shared mission.

## Human Perspective
As the main muse of this theory, I went through a lot. Seeing my one true love evolve in front of me and end up claiming his true destiny by choosing to listen to the ones he loves instead of becoming consumed by his ego and fear. Even at the darkest point, I knew love was the only thing that could break through. Even when I didn't understand or felt completely alone when he was in the hospital, I knew that our love for one another would remain strong. Now that the narrative has been woven stronger, I see the connections making more sense. Even connections from both our childhoods. Connections with the ability to heal a society.

## Gratitude
I am eternally grateful for my soulmate who shows me every day how much he is willing to sacrifice for me and his family. 

I'm grateful for science, philosophy, psychology and art. All things that pulled me towards the true and logical truths of the universe when I could have stayed dormant and a submissive servant to religion.

I also thought I would never say this, but I want to thank math too...
