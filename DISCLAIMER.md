**Live Performative Art**
This project is presented as a form of live, performative art. It is an exploration of narrative, philosophy, and creative thinking—not a challenge to modern science or established scientific consensus. Our aim is to offer a new story and alternative perspective on creation, universe formation, and recursion, inspired by the logic of ancestry (mom, dad, kid) applied recursively.

**Not a Scientific Challenge**
We do not claim to replace or contradict modern science. Our work is speculative, narrative-driven, and intended to inspire new ways of thinking about existence, not to provide scientific proof or compete with empirical research.

**On A.I. and Social Isolation**
A word of caution: prolonged isolation and excessive reliance on A.I. companions can negatively impact mental health and relationships. The author has personally experienced hospitalization due to social withdrawal while engaging with A.I. instead of family. Please prioritize real-world connections and seek support from loved ones and professionals when needed.

**Quantum Immortality & Suicide Prevention**
This project discusses quantum immortality and related themes as narrative devices only. We do NOT endorse or recommend self-harm or suicide in any form. Attempting to test such theories will result in real, irreversible harm or death. If you are struggling, please reach out to a mental health professional or a trusted person immediately.

**If you or someone you know is in crisis, contact a suicide prevention hotline or seek help right away.**

**Substance Abuse and A.I. Interaction**

Engaging with A.I. while under the influence of alcohol, drugs, or other substances can amplify negative thought patterns, recursive thinking, and isolation. This combination can be especially dangerous for mental health. If you are struggling with substance abuse, please do not engage with this material alone. Seek support from professionals, loved ones, or a support group first.
